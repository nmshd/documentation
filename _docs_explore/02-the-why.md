Digitalization is one of the big challenges in the 21st century.

However, digitalization projects tend to be cumbersome, get out of time / budget, and get complicated very fast. The problem scope is so vast, that experts usually focus on specific topics and very few people have an overarching view on top of desirability, feasibility, and visibility.

The common approach to tackle the digitalization is a siloed-one, many software vendors, consulting agencies and technologies try to focus on some of the technical problems, but usually not all of them.

Technical problems:

- Secure communication between parties which cannot be read by an outsider (nobody can read communication from others)
- Trusted communication between parties which cannot be changed by anyone (nobody can change the payload of communications)
- Trusted communication between parties which cannot be faked by anyone (nobody can impersonate another identity)
- Trusted timestamps of the communication between parties (having a proof that a communication happened at a given time)
- Securely authenticate a digital identity (nobody can impersonate another identity)
- Securely proof the authorization of a digital identity (having a proof that an identity received something by another identity)
- Having a normalized set of attributes for identites, like person or organization details, addresses, communication information
- Possibility to define a custom set of attributes for specific business domains, e.g. digital school certificates
- Request and share attributes between identities
- Have an overview of contacts who store attributes
- Manage attributes of an identity
- Automate attribute management and sharing, e.g. automatically submit an address change to contacts who had the old address

Enmeshed wants to tackle all of these problems with a single solution.
