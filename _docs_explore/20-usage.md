# Real-world problems

Let us categorize the

- Secure communication between parties which cannot be read by an outsider (nobody can read communication from others)
- Trusted communication between parties which cannot be changed by anyone (nobody can change the payload of communications)
- Trusted communication between parties which cannot be faked by anyone (nobody can impersonate another identity)
- Trusted timestamps of the communication between parties (having a proof that a communication happened at a given time)
- Securely authenticate a digital identity (nobody can impersonate another identity)
- Securely proof the authorization of a digital identity (having a proof that an identity received something by another identity)
- Having a normalized set of attributes for identites, like person or organization details, addresses, communication information
- Possibility to define a custom set of attributes for specific business domains, e.g. digital school certificates
- Request and share attributes between identities
- Have an overview of contacts who store attributes
- Manage attributes of an identity
- Automate attribute management and sharing, e.g. automatically submit an address change to contacts who had the old address

Enmeshed tries to tackle all of these problems with a single solution.

- Existing digital accounts for customers or employees can be integrated (supporting multiple identity providers)
- Existing data can be shared with the identity to speed up the onboarding
- Multi-Device Support
- Multi-Device Synchronization
