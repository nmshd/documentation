Enmeshed should not only enable users taking part of the digitalization process. Organizations should benefit of Enmeshed as well, maybe even more than the users, as organizations usually need to invest heavily to stay up to date in todays technological race.

Enmeshed is a flexible communication platform, with a rich default feature set and possibilities to extend the features at will. Additionally, we tried to be as integrateable as possible, encapsulating the complexity within the underlying layers.

The Enmeshed Connector is the heart of an organization's Enmeshed identity: It provides a modern REST API within the organizations network.

- Easy setup & integration
- Support for integration modules and partner ecosystem
