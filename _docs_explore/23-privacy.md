Privacy is one of the main pillars of digitalization approaches. It might be the most important one.

There are many laws, regulations, user and organizational notions to take into consideration.

We came up with an approach which is highly scalable and maintainable, without having personal or sensitive data in access. Additionally, the actual processes between persons and organizations were considered and the personal data shared between them is reduced to a minimum.

# Backbone Privacy

The most prominent component in terms of privacy is the Backbone. As a centrally hosted component by a third-party, it is understandable that privacy-related questions usually focus this component.

The answer to those questions is simple: No personal data is stored within the Backbone. Thus privacy is of less concern in the backbone. In the whole user registration and onboarding processes, third parties hosting the Backbone won't receive any personal data, thus can additionally not store any personal data outside the backbone.

Without the actual keys from the respective identities (which the hosting party does not receive) the actual data cannot be decrypted or analyzed.

However, the metadata of identities stored on the Backbone could be analyzed. For example, how many identities have a relationship with another identity – this could for example be used to extract the number of customers an organization has.

## Least Knowledge

The term least-knowledge applies to parties which do not have access to personal data.

Enmeshed is based on such a least-knowledge principle:

- The enmeshed App stores the data in a local database on the device it is running on. Data can only be sent to or received from the Backbone, no other Internet access is possible.
- The enmeshed Connector stores the data in a local database within the organization network. Data can only be sent to or received from the Backbone, no other Internet access is possible.
- Data received from or sent to the Backbone is either pseudonymous (e.g. addresses), non-personalized (e.g. ids, dates, states) or encrypted in a way, that the Backbone cannot process this data.
- Keys to encrypted material on the Backbone are never transmitted in a way, that the Backbone could make use of it. For example, keys are shared on a side-channel (e.g. scan qr-code from website) or an end-to-end encrypted communication channel.
- The enmeshed app allows you to customize access for people and systems so that only necessary resources are shared.
- The enmeshed App can synchronize data of the same identity to other enmeshed Apps of this identity. This is done over a device-to-device encrypted communication channel (via the Backbone). The keys for this communication channel are transferred via a side-channel when onboarding a device for an identity.

## Analyzing metadata

The threat of metadata analytics should not be underestimated and can also not be eradicated by us unfortunately. Thus, a Backbone operator might still be able to analyze metadata stored within the Backbone although it is "least knowledge".

# Comparison to decentral technologies

When comparing the enmeshed privacy with decentral approaches discussed in the world wide web, we do not see any disadvantages with a central architecture. The data stored or shared is effectively the same, resulting in the same possible metadata analysis.

However, there are some advantages to a central architecture:

- With a central architecture, it is generally possible to restrict the access to data on a network level. Only the sender and recipients of a message have access to the encrypted payload of this message, for example. Even if the data is encrypted or pseunodymized, on a decentral architecture everybody would still have access to the encrypted payload.
- With a central architecture, the analysis of metadata can only be done by the central player. On a decentral system, anybody could analyse the metadata.
- With a central architecture, it is generally possible to effectively delete data (or let it expire). Although there are also some decentral technologies allowing the deletion of data, there is no guarantee, that data which was available in the decentral network prior to deletion, is really deleted from any node or node backup of the network.

## **What is Personal Data?**

"Personal data is any information that relates to an **identified or identifiable living individual**. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data.

Personal data that has been de-identified, encrypted or **pseudonymised** but can be used to re-identify a person remains personal data and falls within the scope of the GDPR."

## **What is Personal Data for Enmeshed?**

The notion "Personal data that has been de-identified, encrypted or **pseudonymised** but can be used to re-identify a person remains personal data." does have many implications for Enmeshed - as to any other solution.

We are no lawyers or respected data privacy experts within the community, thus our interpretation of the data privacy regulations is a very narrow one:

1. Pseudonyms or technical identifiers like Enmeshed Addresses, Enmeshed Public Keys, Device Ids, etc. are personal data, if the system has the possibility of mapping these pseudonyms to real world persons
2. One-way functions (hashes/digests) of personal data are considered as personal data, if the system has the possibility of mapping these hashes to real world persons or could potentially map the hashes to real world persons (hashes without salts, public rainbow tables, etc...)
3. Encrypted personal data is still considered personal data, if the system has the possibility of decrypting the personal data (e.g. if it still has the keys) or could potentially decrypt the personal data without having the keys (weak or old encryption)
4. Metadata like Timestamps or Relationships are personal data, if the system has the possibility of mapping these metadata to real-world persons (e.g. if the Backbone could deduct the person by knowing that a real world person triggered a Backbone action at the same time or by analyzing the relationships of an Identity)
