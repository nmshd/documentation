# Scalability

-   Highly scalable central architecture
    -   Horizontal (more servers)
    -   Vertical (more power per server)
-   No architectural throughput limit or maximum transactions per hour
-   Direct transactions without waiting for blocks to be forged

# Locality

-   Support of local data centers
-   Support of geo-replicated data

# Development Speed

-   Speed of implementation and new features, no consortia to talk with
-   Speed of bugfixes/network fixes
