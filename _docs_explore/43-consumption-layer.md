# Enmeshed Schema

Cross-identity payload definitions, normalized structured data

Examples:

-   Definition of "Mail"
-   Definition of how someone can request a certain attribute of another identity?

# Possible additional Schemas

# Schema Consumption

Single-identity business logic implementation and data structures, either for persons or organizational identities.

Examples:

-   Definition and implementation what should be (automatically) done when receiving a structured attribute request (e.g. send the attribute automatically to the identity if user allowed it, ask the user to fill the attribute first if it is not available)
-   Store a current state of shared attributes with every relationship
