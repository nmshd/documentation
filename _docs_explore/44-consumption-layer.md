Single-identity business logic implementation and data structures, either for persons or organizational identities.

Examples:

- Definition and implementation what should be (automatically) done when receiving a structured attribute request (e.g. send the attribute automatically to the identity if user allowed it, ask the user to fill the attribute first if it is not available)
- Store a current state of shared attributes with every relationship
