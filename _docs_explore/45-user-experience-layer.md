The user experience layer is only available within the App and sits on top of the transport and consumption layers. It exposes the functionality of underlying layers for the user, meaning it is rendering out user interfaces and handling interactions. It acts for a single identity only, which is usually a person. However, it might make sense to use an App for organization identities as well, for example for small companies or freelancers.
