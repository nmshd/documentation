You can find many Connector-specific information in the [integrate](/integrate) part of these docs.

# Connector Building Blocks

## Connector Docker Image

The Connector is usually deployed with a Docker image. The Docker images can be fetched from [the GitHub container registry](https://github.com/nmshd/cns-connector/pkgs/container/connector) using your Docker client.

**Note:** You have to be logged in using a GitHub account to list available tags.
{: .notice--warning}

The Docker images are created, maintained and published by j&s-soft GmbH.

## Connector Runtime

Just like the [App Runtime](/explore/app#app-runtime) extends the [Enmeshed Runtime](/explore/runtime) for user interfaces, the Connector Runtime is extending the [Enmeshed Runtime](/explore/runtime) for the use within services and programs. For example, it maps REST-API-calls to Enmeshed business-logic.
