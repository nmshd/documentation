You want to seamlessly use Enmeshed with your processes, solutions and software components? No worries, you are good to go!

Enmeshed brings various integration capabilities with it:

# Setup a Connector

First things first, you would need an Enmeshed Connector running in your landscape.

# Use the Connector API

If you already have some software in place, which helps you with integration - or if you would only like to integrate Enmeshed with a small set of systems, the Connector's REST API might be sufficient.
With this API, you can access the transport-layer functionality of the Connector
