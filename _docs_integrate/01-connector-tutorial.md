In this tutorial we go through the basic steps necessary to establish a Relationship to another Identity and send Messages between two Identities with an existing Relationship. This will create a better understanding of these processes, which will help you automating them for your organization.

The following steps include small pieces of the Connector's API documentation that, when executed, fire requests on a Connector created for testing purposes. So if you don't have an own Connector installed, feel free to use the samples directly. Otherwise you can use your own Connector either with a REST client (e.g. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)) or by using the RapiDoc documentation (`/docs/rapidoc`) hosted on your connector (you have to [enable docs on your connector](http://localhost:4000/integrate/connector-configuration#corehttpapi) for the documentation route to work).

# Prerequisites

-   If you want to use your own Connector for executing the examples
    -   [install the Connector]({% link _docs_integrate/10-connector-installation.md %})
    -   make sure the [Sync Module is disabled]({% link _docs_integrate/11-connector-configuration.md %}) (because in this tutorial we will synchronize manually via the HTTP endpoint)
    -   get the API key configured for the Connector. Ask the person who installed the Connector for it.
-   You need the [Enmeshed App]({% link _docs_use/01-basics.md %}) installed on your mobile device.

# Establishing a Relationship

In order to communicate with another Identity, a Relationship to that Identity is required. In this first part of the tutorial you will learn how to establish a Relationship between your Connector and another Identity. In this case the other Identity will be the using the App, but it could be another Connector as well.

## Connector: Create a Relationship Template

Start by creating a so called Relationship Template on the Connector. You can do so by calling the `POST /api/v1/RelationshipTemplates/Own` route. Use the following JSON in the request body:

```json
{
    "maxNumberOfRelationships": 10,
    "expiresAt": "2022-06-01T00:00.000Z",
    "content": {
        "attributes": [
            {
                "name": "Thing.name",
                "value": "Contoso"
            }
        ],
        "request": {
            "required": [
                {
                    "attribute": "Person.familyName"
                },
                {
                    "attribute": "Person.givenName"
                }
            ],
            "optional": [
                {
                    "attribute": "Comm.email"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

{% include rapidoc api_route_regex="^post /api/v1/RelationshipTemplates/Own$" title="" %}

Remember the `id` of the Relationship Template that you can find in the response. You will need it in the next step.

## Connector: Create a Token

Now you need a so called Token. Since we will use the Enmeshed App to send a Relationship Request to the Connector, we further have to create a QR Code one can scan with the App to retrieve the Relationship Template and send a Relationship Request to the Connector. Execute the `POST /api/v1/RelationshipTemplates/Own/{id}/Token` route to create such a Token. Use the ID of the Relationship Template from the previous step as the value for `id`. Make sure you select `image/png` as the `Accept` header by selecting the corresponding value from the dropdown list in the bottom right of the Rapidoc route section.

We don't care about the parameters here, so just send an empty JSON in the request body.

{% include rapidoc api_route_regex="^post /api/v1/RelationshipTemplates/Own/{id}/Token$" title="" %}

## App: Send a Relationship Request

Open the created QR Code, start the Enmeshed App, select or create a profile, navigate to "Kontakte", click on "Kontakt hinzufügen" and scan the QR Code. This will open a screen similar to the one below, where you can see the information that you have added as content to the Relationship Template.
!["Add contact" screen](/assets/images/add-contact-screen.jpg)

Finally, click on "Kontakt hinzufügen" to send the Relationship Request. This will create a new Relationship to the Backbone, which has the status `Pending`.

## Connector: Accept the Relationship Request

In order to move it into the `Active` state, you now need to accept the Relationship Request with the Connector. In order to do so, first execute the `POST /api/v1/api/v1/Account/Sync` route, which will fetch all changes that occurred since the last time this endpoint was executed. In the response you will receive the created Relationship, which contains corresponding Relationship Creation Change.

Example:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "messages": [],
    "relationships": [
      {
        "id": "RELmJj25x2bZW0VXzAiQ",
        ...
        "status": "Pending",
        "peer": "id19Sy75wjCWhQSxsbMiGLn6iSBfWvQmot5b",
        "changes": [
          {
            "id": "RCHUwBw7BWlROPlEjb51",
            ...
            "status": "Pending",
            "type": "Creation"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

{% include rapidoc api_route_regex="^post /api/v1/Account/Sync$" title="" %}

Remember the `id` of the Relationship (`REL_________________`) as well as the `id` of the first Relationship Change (`RCH_________________`) in the `changes` array and use them as input to the `PUT /api/v1/Relationships/{id}/Changes/{changeId}/Accept` route. You can leave that request body as it is.

{% include rapidoc api_route_regex="^put /api/v1/Relationships/{id}/Changes/{changeId}/Accept$" title="" %}
