You want to seamlessly use enmeshed with your processes, solutions and software components? No worries, you are good to go!

We've built the enmeshed Connector exactly for this scenario: to integrate existing systems with the enmeshed approach with as little effort as possible.

Here you'll find everything you need to seamlessly dive into the world of enmeshed and integrate it into your applications and systems. Whether you're just starting out or are already familiar with enmeshed, our comprehensive guide and resources are at your disposal.

## Getting Started

Begin your integration journey by familiarizing yourself with the [Connector REST API]({% link _docs_integrate/access-the-connector.md %}) and exploring the fundamental steps for integration. Gain insights into effectively utilizing the [Connector SDKs]({% link _docs_integrate/access-the-connector.md %}#accessing-the-connector-by-software-development-kits-sdk) to streamline and optimize your integration. To get a first impression of certain integration processes, take a look at our [Integration example]({% link _docs_integrate/integration-example.md %}). Discover how events work and how you can leverage them in your application in the [Event introduction]({% link _docs_integrate/event-introduction.md %}).

## Relationships Between Identities

Learn how to [establish a Relationship]({% link _docs_integrate/establish-relationships.md %}) to another Identity in order to be able to communicate and exchange information with it. Furthermore, explore how to [exchange Messages]({% link _docs_integrate/exchange-messages.md %}) using enmeshed to communicate simply and securely with your peers.

## Working With Requests

Learn how to create and manage Requests. Check out the [Request and Response introduction]({% link _docs_integrate/request-and-response-introduction.md %}) and the [Requests via RelationshipTemplates]({% link _docs_integrate/requests-via-relationshiptemplates.md %}) and [Requests via Messages]({% link _docs_integrate/requests-via-messages.md %}) guides.

## Manage Attributes

The [Attribute introduction]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-introduction.md %}) provides an overview of the different kinds of Attributes and the Attribute management options. Next, explore how to [create Attributes for yourself]({% link _docs_integrate/create-attributes-for-yourself.md %}) and how to [share Attributes]({% link _docs_integrate/share-attributes-with-peer.md %}) with a peer. Also, discover how to [read Attributes]({% link _docs_integrate/read-attributes-from-peer.md %}) from a peer and how to store Attributes in a peer's Wallet for them. The latter can be realized by [creating Attributes]({% link _docs_integrate/create-attributes-for-peer.md %}) for them or by [proposing Attributes]({% link _docs_integrate/propose-attributes-to-peer.md %}) to them. The peer must give you their permission for this. Furthermore, learn how to [update Attributes by succession]({% link _docs_integrate/update-attributes-by-succession.md %}) or how to [delete Attributes]({% link _docs_integrate/delete-attributes.md %}).

## Request Consent

Discover how to request [persistent consent]({% link _docs_integrate/request-persistent-consent-of-peer.md %}) and [one-time consent]({% link _docs_integrate/request-one-time-consent-of-peer.md %}) of a peer.

## Data Model

Understand the [Data Model]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}) of enmeshed and how it fits into your integration. Also get an overview of the [Attribute Values]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-values.md %}), the [Connector Events]({% link _docs_integrate/connector-events.md %}) and our [Use Cases]({% link _docs_integrate/use-cases.md %}).

## Migration Guides

Get support for the migration of an existing system to a new version, for example when [migrating from version 4 to version 5]({% link _docs_integrate/migration-from-v4-to-v5.md %}) of the enmeshed Runtime and Connector, respectively.

## Troubleshooting

Here you can find the [Error codes]({% link _docs_integrate/error-codes.md %}) and our [FAQ]({% link _docs_integrate/faq.md %}) page.
