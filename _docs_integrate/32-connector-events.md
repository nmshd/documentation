## RequestStatusChangedEventData

Every event is structured as follows (TData depends on the actual event, e.g. `LocalAttribute`):

```ts
interface Event<TData> {
    namespace: string;
    eventTargetAddress: string;
    data: TData;
}
```

### RequestStatusChangedEventData

> [LocalRequest]({% link _docs_explore/62-data-model.md %}#LocalRequest)

```ts
export interface RequestStatusChangedEventData {
    request: LocalRequest;
    oldStatus: LocalRequestStatus;
    newStatus: LocalRequestStatus;
}
```

## MessageProcessedEventData

> [Message]({% link _docs_explore/62-data-model.md %}#Message)

```ts
export interface MessageProcessedEventData {
    message: MessageDTO;
    result: "ManualRequestDecisionRequired" | "NoRequest" | "Error";
}
```

## RelationshipTemplateProcessedEventData

> [RelationshipTemplate]({% link _docs_explore/62-data-model.md %}#RelationshipTemplate)

```ts
export interface RelationshipTemplateProcessedEventData {
    template: RelationshipTemplateDTO;
    result: "ManualRequestDecisionRequired" | "NonCompletedRequestExists" | "RelationshipExists" | "NoRequest" | "Error";
}
```
