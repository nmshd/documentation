## RequestStatusChangedEventData

Every event is structured as follows (TData depends on the actual event, e.g. `LocalAttribute`):

```ts
interface Event<TData> {
    namespace: string;
    eventTargetAddress: string;
    data: TData;
}
```

### RequestStatusChangedEventData

```ts
export interface RequestStatusChangedEventData {
    Request: LocalRequestDTO;
    oldStatus: LocalRequestStatus;
    newStatus: LocalRequestStatus;
}
```
