The enmeshed data model can be divided into three parts:

- Transport types
- Local types
- Content types

The following diagram gives you an overview of all the existing types and how they are connected to each other. The subsequent chapters describe these types in more detail.

(note that you can click on each type in order to navigate to the paragraph with the corresponding description)

At a first glance the amount of types is overwhelming. But in the following chapters all of them are explained in detail.

# Transport Types

Transport types like `RelationshipTemplate`, `Token` or `File` are types that are "exchanged" between Identities via the Backbone. They are created and updated by the [Transport Layer]({% link _docs_explore/42-transport-layer.md %}). In most cases they have a `content` property, which contains the actual payload that should be transferred between the Identities. This payload is being encrypted when it is sent to the Backbone, and decrypted by the other Identity when it is received. The following sections describe the different Transport types and their properties.

Note that the properties of the types are the ones that exist locally (aka on the Connector/in the App). The Backbone does not necessarily know about them. The properties that only exist locally are marked accordingly in the tables below. Further there are properties that are confidential and are therefore encrypted before sent to the Backbone, in order to enable end-to-end encryption. Both kinds of these properties are marked accordingly in the "Remarks" column of the property tables below.

## Token

Tokens can be used to save arbitrary structured data on the Backbone, which is encrypted with a random symmetric key. You can then pass the ID of the Token, together with the random key, to another Identity, which can then retrieve the token and decrypt it, e.g. inside of a QR code, which you send to the recipient via letter. Tokens can be handy in a lot of scenarios, for example:

- You want to share secret information with someone you don't have a Relationship with.
- The enmeshed App currently uses a Token to save a Backup of the Identity. ID and secret key are then encoded in a QR code, which the user can print out and scan later in order to restore the Identity on a new device.

A Token has the following properties:

| isEphemeral        | `boolean` | If set to `true` the Token will not be cached in the database and only displayed once. You will not be able to fetch this Token unless you remember its truncatedReference. |

## RelationshipTemplate

A RelationshipTemplate serves two purposes:

1. It represents the permission to establish a Relationship. When initiating a Relationship, the ID of a valid RelationshipTemplate must be attached. Otherwise the Backbone blocks the Relationship. And since the IDs are randomly generated, you can only obtain such an ID from the RelationshipTemplate's owner.
2. It can contain data which is of interest for the one who uses the RelationshipTemplate. The enmeshed App for example expects a RelationshipTemplate content which contains a `Request` which contains e.g. Attributes about the creator of the RelationshipTemplate as well as queries for Attributes that the RelationshipTemplate creator wants to receive together with the Relationship.

## Relationship

A Relationship between two Identities is the prerequisite for them to exchange Messages. If there is no Relationship, the Backbone blocks all Messages that are tried to be sent.

## Message

A Message is a piece of data that can be sent to one or more recipients. The sender is completely free in what the content of the Message looks like. Though in order to enable a normalized communication, enmeshed defines some `content` structures for Messages, and in the future there will be more of those. Consider that the enmeshed App only supports Messages with such a normalized `content`. Currently there are:

- [`Mail`](#mail)
- [`Request`](#request)
- [`ResponseWrapper`](#responsewrapper)
- [`Notification`](#notification)

You can read more details about each of these in the corresponding sections of the "Content Types" chapter.

But if you are communicating with another Connector, you can use the [`ArbitraryMessageContent`](#arbitrarymessagecontent) to send any structure that fits your needs.

## File

The Backbone allows you to upload files, which are saved as - you guessed it - `Files`.

A File further has its content, of course. But since this is not a JSON property, it is not included in this table. You can download the content of the File separately.

## Identity

| Name      | Type     | Description                         | Remarks |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- | ------- |

| publicKey | `string` | The public key of the Identity.     |         |

## IdentityDeletionProcess

If you want to delete your [Identity](#identity), the actual deletion of all data associated with that Identity will only take place after a certain grace period has ended.
Up until then, the data about the deletion process is stored in an object called IdentityDeletionProcess.
It is possible to [cancel an IdentityDeletionProcess]({% link _docs_use-cases/use-case-transport-cancel-identitydeletionprocess.md %}) that hasn't reached the end of its grace period, yet.
Furthermore, the deletion of an Identity can be initiated by the Backbone Admin UI.
In this case, the Identity has to [approve the IdentityDeletionProcess]({% link _docs_use-cases/use-case-transport-approve-identitydeletionprocess.md %}) in order to start the grace period.
The IdentityDeletionProcess can also be [rejected]({% link _docs_use-cases/use-case-transport-reject-identitydeletionprocess.md %}) if an Identity does not agree with its deletion initiated by the Backbone Admin UI.
Since rejected and cancelled IdentityDeletionProcesses are stored, you can reach a situation in which there are multiple IdentityDeletionProcesses associated with the same Identity.
Note, however, that at all times there can only be at most one active IdentityDeletionProcess, i.e. with `status` `"WaitingForApproval"` or `"Approved"`, per Identity.

# Local Types

In addition to the types that are shared between Identities via the Backbone, there are certain types that only exist within one Identity. These types usually contain metadata about [Content types](#content-types) that should not be transferred to other Identities. They are created and updated by the [Consumption Layer]({% link _docs_explore/43-consumption-layer.md %}).

Currently there are three main Local types:

- LocalRequest
- LocalNotification
- LocalAttribute

Each of them further describes some sub types.

This chapter explains all of those types, together with their properties.

## LocalRequest

A LocalRequest contains the local metadata for a [Request](#request).

| Name      | Type                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| isOwn     | `boolean`                                                  | `true` if you sent the Request, `false` if you received it.                                                                                  |
| peer      | `string`                                                   | The Identity that sent you the corresponding Request/that you sent the Request to.                                                           |
| createdAt | `string`                                                   | {% include descr_createdAt class="LocalRequest" %}                                                                                           |
| status    | [`LocalRequestStatus`](#localrequeststatus)                | The current status of the Request. See [below](#localrequeststatus) for a list of all possible values.                                       |
| content   | [`Request`](#request)                                      | The actual Content object this LocalRequest defines the metadata for.                                                                        |
| source    | [`LocalRequestSource`](#localrequestsource) \| `undefined` | Information about the Transport object with which the Request came in/was sent. This property is `undefined` if the Request is not sent yet. |
| response  | [`LocalResponse`](#localresponse) \| `undefined`           | Metadata + Content object of the response. If there is no response yet, this property is `undefined`.                                        |

### LocalRequestStatus

Depending on whether it is an incoming or an outgoing Request, there can be different statuses. The following state diagram shows which status exists in both cases and when there are transitions from one state to another:

![State diagram for LocalRequest Status]( {{ '/assets/images/explore/RequestStatus%20-%20State%20Diagram.png' | relative_url }} )

Draft
: This status only exists for outgoing Requests. It means that the LocalRequest was created, but not yet sent.

Open
: In case of an outgoing Request, `Open` means that the Request was sent. The transition to `Open` happens automatically when you send the Request with a Message.
: In case of an incoming Request, `Open` means that the LocalRequest was received.

DecisionRequired
: After the prerequisites of the Request and all of its RequestItems were checked, a decision can be made. At first, the [Decider Module]({% link _docs_explore/61-runtime.md %}#decider-module) tries to make an automatic decision. It therefore checks all LocalRequests in status `DecisionRequired`.

ManualDecisionRequired
: If the Decider Module cannot make a decision, it moves the LocalRequest to `ManualDecisionRequired`. When the LocalRequest is in this status, it's the User's turn to decide whether they want to accept or reject the Request.

Decided
: When the User or the Decider Module accepts or rejects the Request, the Response and ResponseItems are generated based on the passed parameters. This Response is saved in the `response` property of the `LocalRequest`, but not yet sent.

Completed
: In case of an incoming Request, the Runtime Module listens to an Event saying that a Request moved to status `Decided`. It then checks on which way the Request was received (Message/RelationshipTemplate) and sends the Response on the corresponding way (by sending a Message or creating a Relationship). After the Response was successfully sent, it moves the LocalRequest to `Completed`.
: In case of an outgoing Request, the Runtime Module listens to the `MessageReceivedEvent` and checks the content of the sent Message for a Response. If there is one, it moves the corresponding LocalRequest to `Completed`.

: When the timestamp in `expiresAt` of a Request is reached, the Request automatically moves to the status `Expired`.

### LocalRequestSource

With the information in this type you can clearly identify the Transport object the Request was sent/received in. Currently there are only two possibilities: Message and RelationshipTemplate.

| Name      | Type                                    | Description                                                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type      | `"Message"` \| `"RelationshipTemplate"` | The type of Transport object the Request was sent/received in.   |
| reference | `string`                                | The ID of the Transport object the Request was sent/received in. |

### LocalResponse

When a LocalRequest is decided/received, a Local Response is generated, which contains the Response, together with some metadata.

| Name      | Type                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                             |

| source    | [`LocalResponseSource`](#localresponsesource) \| `undefined` | Information about the Transport object with which the Response came in/was sent. This property is `undefined` if the Response is not sent/received yet. |

### LocalResponseSource

With the information in this type you can clearly identify the Transport object the Response was sent/received in. Currently there are only two possibilities: Message and Relationship.

| Name      | Type                            | Description                                                       |

## LocalNotification

A LocalNotification contains the local metadata for a [Notification](#notification).

| Name             | Type                                                  | Description                                                                                                                             |

### LocalNotificationStatus

Depending on whether it is an incoming or an outgoing Notification, there can be different statuses.

Sent
: This is the only valid status on sender side. If a Notification is sent and, therefore, a LocalNotification is created, its status will be set to `Sent`.

Open
: Receiving a Notification, a LocalNotification is created with status `Open`.

Completed
: After receiving a Notification, its items will be processed internally. If all processes finish successfully, the status of the LocalNotification will be set to `Completed`.

Error
: If an error occurs while processing the items of a received Notification, the status of the LocalNotification will be set to `Error`.

### LocalNotificationSource

With the information in this type you can clearly identify the Transport object the Notification was sent/received in. Currently, the only possibility for transmitting Notifications are Messages.

| Name      | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type      | "Message" | The type of Transport object the Notification was sent/received in. So far, Notifications can only be transmitted via [Messages](#message). |
| reference | `string`  | The `id` of the Transport object the Notification was sent/received in.                                                                     |

## LocalAttribute

A LocalAttribute stores the local metadata for an [Attribute](#attributes). This is contained within the `content` property of the LocalAttribute. The Attribute can be an [IdentityAttribute](#identityattribute) or a [RelationshipAttribute](#relationshipattribute). In the case of IdentityAttributes, there are three situations in which a LocalAttribute is created in the database:

- The Identity [creates an IdentityAttribute for itself]({% link _docs_integrate/create-attributes-for-yourself.md %}#create-an-identityattribute-for-yourself) (e.g. sets its first name). In particular, it is the `owner` of the IdentityAttribute. Its `shareInfo` property is undefined. Such an unshared LocalAttribute is called a **RepositoryAttribute**.
- The Identity shares an IdentityAttribute of itself with another Identity (e.g. by [exchanging]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-introduction.md %}#exchange-attributes-with-peers) it using a suitable [Request]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#request)). In that case, a _copy_ of the RepositoryAttribute used as the source is created for which the `shareInfo` property is set. This LocalAttribute is referred to as an **own shared IdentityAttribute**.
- The Identity receives an IdentityAttribute from another Identity (e.g. receives it via a [Request]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#request)). In that case a _new_ LocalAttribute is created for which the `shareInfo` property is set. This LocalAttribute is called a **peer shared IdentityAttribute**.

In contrast, [RelationshipAttributes](#relationshipattribute) always exist in the context of a [Relationship](#relationship).
For this reason, it is not possible for an Identity to have an unshared RelationshipAttribute.
The [creation of a RelationshipAttribute]({% link _docs_integrate/create-attributes-for-yourself.md %}#create-a-relationshipattribute) corresponds to the creation of one LocalAttribute for its `owner` and one LocalAttribute for the peer with whom the `owner` has established the Relationship in whose context the RelationshipAttribute is to exist.

- We refer to the LocalAttribute of the `owner` as an **own shared RelationshipAttribute**.
- The peer’s LocalAttribute is referred to as a **peer shared RelationshipAttribute**.

If the underlying RelationshipAttribute of an own shared RelationshipAttribute is shared with a peer who is not involved in the Relationship in which the RelationshipAttribute exists, this results in the creation of two LocalAttributes, an **own shared ThirdPartyRelationshipAttribute** on the one hand and a **peer shared ThirdPartyRelationshipAttribute** on the other.
The two LocalAttributes that are created when sharing an underlying RelationshipAttribute of a peer shared RelationshipAttribute with a peer who is not involved in the Relationship in which the RelationshipAttribute exists are both referred to as a **third party owned RelationshipAttribute**.
In the [Attribute introduction]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-introduction.md %}) more details on the terminology related to LocalAttributes can be found.

### LocalAttributeShareInfo

The LocalAttributeShareInfo helps to keep track of how the LocalAttribute was received/sent, from whom it was received/who sent it, as well as which LocalAttribute it was copied from. For example, this enables us to track back who we shared a certain IdentityAttribute with, so we are able to notify each of those peers when changing it. The Attribute can be either transmitted via Request or Notification. Hence, only one of `requestReference` and `notificationReference` can be set.

| sourceAttribute       | `string` \| `undefined` | If the [LocalAttribute](#localattribute) is an own shared IdentityAttribute, then this property contains the `id` of the RepositoryAttribute it was copied from. Also, if a RelationshipAttribute is shared with a third party, i.e. in the context of a Relationship that is different to the one the RelationshipAttribute was initially created in, this ThirdPartyRelationshipAttribute will link to the source RelationshipAttribute. Note that `sourceAttribute` is only defined for the peer who also has the Attribute this property links to. Regarding IdentityAttributes this is the owner. For ThirdPartyRelationshipAttributes it is the peer who is in the Relationship the source RelationshipAttribute is copied from. |

### LocalAttributeDeletionInfo

The LocalAttributeDeletionInfo holds information about the deletion status of the counterpart of a shared Attribute, as well as the point in time of that deletion.
If the Attribute's `owner` requests the deletion of a shared Attribute via a [DeleteAttributeRequestItem](#deleteattributerequestitem) from the peer, their own shared Attribute will get `"DeletionRequestSent"` as `deletionStatus` and the time of sending the Request as `deletionDate`.
Should the peer reject the DeleteAttributeRequestItem, the own shared Attribute of the `owner` is given `"DeletionRequestRejected"` as `deletionStatus`.
The `deletionDate` then will be set to the time of receiving the [RejectResponseItem](#rejectresponseitem).
If they accept, however, using the [AcceptDeleteAttributeRequestItemParameters](#acceptdeleteattributerequestitemparameters), the `deletionStatus` of the peer shared Attribute of the peer will be set to `"ToBeDeleted"` and its `deletionDate` will be set to the `deletionDate` the peer sent in their Response.
Accordingly, the `deletionStatus` of the own shared Attribute of the owner will move to `"ToBeDeletedByPeer"` with the same `deletionDate`.
Once the peer shared Attribute is deleted by the peer, a [PeerSharedAttributeDeletedByPeerNotificationItem](#peersharedattributedeletedbypeernotificationitem) is sent to the owner, where the `deletionStatus` of the own shared Attribute is set to `"DeletedByPeer"` with the current time stamp as `deletionDate`.
Likewise, if the owner deletes their own shared Attribute, before the peer deleted their corresponding peer shared Attribute, an [OwnSharedAttributeDeletedByOwnerNotificationItem](#ownsharedattributedeletedbyownernotificationitem) is sent to the peer.
If the `deletionInfo` of the peer was undefined before, the `deletionStatus` will be set to `"DeletedByOwner"` with the current time stamp as `deletionDate`.
However, if the `deletionInfo` was defined before with `"ToBeDeleted"` as `deletionStatus`, it will remain unchanged, such that the peer will be able to delete their peer shared Attribute as planned.
This will be the case, if the peer already accepted the DeleteAttributeRequestItem for this particular Attribute.

## LocalAttributeListener

A LocalAttributeListener is created when you accept an incoming Request with a [`RegisterAttributeListenerRequestItem`](#registerattributelistenerrequestitem). It is used to keep track of which Attribute Listeners currently exist and what they are listening for.

# Content Types

Content Types can be seen as a data contract between Identities. The medium through which this data is exchanged are the [Transport types](#transport-types) (e.g. Messages, Tokens, ...). This chapter shows all the Content types and describes their intended usage.

## Request

A Request allows you to ask another Identity to do something. What this "something" is depends on which of the so called [RequestItems](#requestitems) were added to the Request (e.g. [`CreateAttributeRequestItem`](}#createattributerequestitem), [`ReadAttributeRequestItem`](#readattributerequestitem), ...). The Request is then sent to the peer via Message or RelationshipTemplate. The peer can then review the Request and decide whether they want to accept or reject it. And if they accept it, they can even choose which of the Items they want to accept. You can also put multiple Items into a [RequestItemGroup](#requestitemgroup) in order to display them visually as a unit.

### RequestItems

RequestItems can be sent inside of a [Request](#request) and specify what should be done when the [Request is accepted]({% link _docs_use-cases/use-case-consumption-accept-incoming-request.md %}). More information on how to use the individual [types of RequestItems]({% link _docs_integrate/request-and-response-introduction.md %}#types-of-requestitems) for your purposes can be found in the [Request and Response introduction]({% link _docs_integrate/request-and-response-introduction.md %}). If you are interested in a brief overview of the various operations which can be performed with Attributes, take a look at our [Attribute management options]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-introduction.md %}#attribute-management-options).

### ResponseItems

ResponseItems are sent inside of a Response.
They contain the response data that is sent by the recipient of the Request.
There are three different kinds of ResponseItems: `AcceptResponseItem`, `RejectResponseItem` and `ErrorResponseItem`.
Depending on the actual [RequestItem](#requestitems) and the [DecideRequestItemParameters](#deciderequestitemparameters) used, there can be different derivations of these three items.
For more information, please consult the respective chapter of the [Request and Response introduction]({% link _docs_integrate/request-and-response-introduction.md %}#types-of-requestitems).

#### AcceptResponseItem

An AcceptResponseItem can be received as answer to an [AuthenticationRequestItem]({% link _docs_integrate/request-and-response-introduction.md %}#authenticationrequestitem) or [ConsentRequestItem]({% link _docs_integrate/request-and-response-introduction.md %}#consentrequestitem).

| Name   | Type                   | Description                                              |
| ------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| @type  | `"AcceptResponseItem"` | The type of the ResponseItem.                            |
| result | `"Accepted"`           | The only possible value here is the string `"Accepted"`. |

##### AttributeAlreadySharedAcceptResponseItem

An AttributeAlreadySharedAcceptResponseItem can be received as answer to a [ReadAttributeRequestItem]({% link _docs_integrate/request-and-response-introduction.md %}#readattributerequestitem) or [ProposeAttributeRequestItem]({% link _docs_integrate/request-and-response-introduction.md %}#proposeattributerequestitem).
It is generated if the Recipient of the RequestItem responds to it with an existing Attribute they already shared with the Sender in case the own shared [LocalAttribute](#localattribute) doesn't have `"DeletedByPeer"` or `"ToBeDeletedByPeer"` as `deletionInfo.deletionStatus`.
Instead of creating a further own shared/peer shared Attribute pair, the `id` of the already existing shared LocalAttributes is returned.
Note that the `id` of the own/peer shared Attribute of the Sender matches the `id` of the corresponding peer/own shared Attribute of the Recipient.

| Name        | Type                                         | Description                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| @type       | `"AttributeAlreadySharedAcceptResponseItem"` | The type of the ResponseItem.                            |
| result      | `"Accepted"`                                 | The only possible value here is the string `"Accepted"`. |
| attributeId | `string`                                     | The `id` of the already existing shared LocalAttributes. |

##### AttributeSuccessionAcceptResponseItem

An AttributeSuccessionAcceptResponseItem can be received as answer to a [ReadAttributeRequestItem]({% link _docs_integrate/request-and-response-introduction.md %}#readattributerequestitem) or [ProposeAttributeRequestItem]({% link _docs_integrate/request-and-response-introduction.md %}#proposeattributerequestitem).
It is generated if the Recipient of the RequestItem responds to it with an existing Attribute that is a successor of an Attribute they already shared with the Sender in case the own shared [LocalAttribute](#localattribute) doesn't have `"DeletedByPeer"` or `"ToBeDeletedByPeer"` as `deletionInfo.deletionStatus`.
Instead of creating an independent own shared/peer shared Attribute pair, internally an [Attribute succession]({% link _docs_integrate/update-attributes-by-succession.md %}) is performed.
The `id` of the already existing shared LocalAttribute predecessor is returned, as well as the `id` and `content` of the newly created successor.
Receiving an AttributeSuccessionAcceptResponseItem, the respective shared LocalAttribute of the Sender of the Request is automatically succeeded accordingly.

| items | [`ResponseItem`](#responseitem)`[]` | The items inside of this Group. For each RequestItem of the RequestItem Group, there must be one Response Item in the Response Item Group. Note that the indices have to be the same for matching Request and Response Items. |

## ResponseWrapper

The ResponseWrapper is a wrapper around the Response that is sent by the recipient of the Request. It contains the Response itself, but also some additional information that is required for the Request to be processed correctly.

## Notification

Notifications provide you with the possibility to notify a peer about something, e.g. the succession of one of your Attributes.
However, unlike [Requests](#request) they don't offer the option to make a decision whether or not they want to accept this change.
In the example of Attribute succession, the peer can not decide to accept or reject the updated value, but is simply informed about it.

| items | [`NotificationItem[]`](#notificationitems) | An array of NotificationItems that are part of the Notification. There must be at least one Item per Notification. |

### NotificationItems

NotificationItems are sent inside a Notification and specify which processes should be triggered when receiving the Notification.

#### OwnSharedAttributeDeletedByOwnerNotificationItem

If a peer has shared one of their Attributes with you and deletes their own shared Attribute, an OwnSharedAttributeDeletedByOwnerNotificationItem will be sent to you.
Internally, for your corresponding peer shared Attribute the `deletionInfo.deletionStatus` will be set to `"DeletedByOwner"` if it wasn't set to `"ToBeDeleted` before.

#### PeerSharedAttributeDeletedByPeerNotificationItem

If you have shared one of your Attributes with a peer and they delete their peer shared Attribute, a PeerSharedAttributeDeletedByPeerNotificationItem will be sent to you.
Internally, for your corresponding own shared Attribute the `deletionInfo.deletionStatus` will be set to `"DeletedByPeer"` .

#### PeerSharedAttributeSucceededNotificationItem

A PeerSharedAttributeSucceededNotificationItem will be sent, if an Attribute, a peer shared with you, was succeeded by them and they choose to notify you about it.
Internally, the succeeded version will then be created at your side as successor for your previously received Attribute.

| Name             | Type                                                                                           | Description                                        |

| successorContent | [`IdentityAttribute`](#identityattribute) \| [`RelationshipAttribute`](#relationshipattribute) | The updated `content` of the LocalAttribute        |

#### ThirdPartyOwnedRelationshipAttributeDeletedByPeerNotificationItem

If you have shared a RelationshipAttribute, that is not owned by you, with a peer from a different Relationship and that peer deletes their third party owned RelationshipAttribute, a ThirdPartyOwnedRelationshipAttributeDeletedByPeerNotificationItem will be sent to you.
Internally, for your corresponding third party owned RelationshipAttribute the `deletionInfo.deletionStatus` will be set to `"DeletedByPeer"`.

| Name        | Type                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Attributes

An Attribute is some piece of information about an Identity itself (e.g. its name, address, birth date, etc.) or about an Identity in the context of a Relationship (e.g. the customer id the of the user the Relationship). Since the two scenarios differ quite a lot, there are two different types for them: IdentityAttribute and RelationshipAttribute.

### IdentityAttribute

IdentityAttributes describe an Identity itself. Their values are strongly normalized. There is a list of available values [here]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-values.md %}).

| Name      | Type                                                                                           | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @type     | `"IdentityAttribute"`                                                                          |                                                                                                                   |
| owner     | `string`                                                                                       | The Identity that owns this Attribute. Only the owner of an Attribute is allowed to change it after its creation. |
| validFrom | `string` \| `undefined`                                                                        | The date from which on the Attribute is valid. Could be in the future if the Attribute is not yet valid.          |
| validTo   | `string` \| `undefined`                                                                        | The date until this Attribute is valid. Could be in the past if the Attribute is already expired.                 |
| value     | [`IdentityAttributeValue`]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-values.md %}#identity-attributes) | The Attribute's value.                                                                                            |
| tags      | `string[]` \| `undefined`                                                                      | To specify additional information.                                                                                |

### RelationshipAttribute

RelationshipAttributes describe an Identity in the context of a Relationship. While there are some types that can be used as a value for a RelationshipAttribute, these types are rather generic (e.g. `ProprietaryString`, `ProprietaryInteger`, ...).

| Name            | Type                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If the confidentiality is `"public"`, everybody can query the Attribute, without anything special to happen. |     |

## AttributeQueries

One of the main features of enmeshed is sharing Attributes. For this, an Identity either proactively sends its Attributes to a peer. Or, if let's say a company wants to know the birth date of its customer, it can ask for it. Depending on the exact use case, the latter can be achieved with one of a bunch of RequestItems, like for example a [`ReadAttributeRequestItem`](#readattributerequestitem), or a [`CreateAttributeListenerRequestItem`](#createattributerequestitem). All of them have in common that they define a `query` property, which contains either an [`IdentityAttributeQuery`](#identityattributequery) or a [`RelationshipAttributeQuery`](#relationshipattributequery).

### IdentityAttributeQuery

An `IdentityAttributeQuery` is used to query for IdentityAttributes. For that, it defines the following properties:

| Name      | Type                       | Description                                                                                         |
| --------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @type     | `"IdentityAttributeQuery"` |                                                                                                     |
| validFrom | `string` \| `undefined`    | The start date of the time frame the returned Attribute should be valid in.                         |
| validTo   | `string` \| `undefined`    | The end date of the time frame the returned Attribute should be valid in.                           |
| valueType | `string`                   | The type of value that should be queried, e.g. `"StreetAddress"`, `"BirthDate"` or `"Nationality"`. |
| tags      | `string[]` \| `undefined`  | To specify additional information.                                                                  |

You can only query IdentityAttributes owned by the recipient of the query.

### RelationshipAttributeQuery

There are cases in which you want to query some data from your peer that is not an IdentityAttribute. An example for this is when an electricity provider asks for the electric meter number of a new customer. Since this information is only relevant in the context of the Relationship, an IdentityAttribute wouldn't make any sense here. That's why you would send a `RelationshipAttributeQuery`. Its properties are:

### ThirdPartyRelationshipAttributeQuery

If you want to query RelationshipAttributes the Recipient has in the context of a Relationship with a third party, you can use the `ThirdPartyRelationshipAttributeQuery`. An example would be the query for the number of a bonus card managed by another company (like Payback). A ThirdPartyRelationshipAttributeQuery has the following properties:

| Name       | Type                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### IQLQuery

If you want to query IdentityAttributes by their content, you can use the `IQLQuery` which is based on the IQL language, a simple and accessible yet powerful query language for IdentityAttributes. It allows you to specify conditions the IdentityAttribute must match and which may be chained using binary operations. Every property of the IdentityAttribute's content may be queried. For a full explanation of the IQL syntax, see its [dedicated documentation page]({% link _docs_integrate/iql-syntax.md %}) which also includes an interactive demo for you to try out different queries. If no IdentityAttribute corresponding to the IQLQuery exists at the peer's side, you are given the possibility to add `attributeCreationHints`, suggesting to create an IdentityAttribute which matches a specific `valueType` and optionally `tags`.

## RelationshipTemplateContent

Theoretically you can send any kind of data in a RelationshipTemplate. However, if your peer uses the enmeshed App, it will only be able to process RelationshipTemplates that contain a `RelationshipTemplateContent`, which looks like this:

| Name                   | Type                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @type                  | `"RelationshipTemplateContent"`      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| title                  | `string` \| `undefined`              | An optional, human readable title that should be rendered in the UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| metadata               | `object` \| `undefined`              | Optional custom metadata that can be sent together with the RelationshipTemplate. This property is meant purely for developers who integrate with enmeshed. They can write for example some kind of key into this property, which can be used later to identify the content of this RelationshipTemplate.                                                                                                                              |
| onNewRelationship      | [`Request`](#request)                | The Request that should pop up to the user in case there is no Relationship yet. In this Request you can send Attributes of yourself the user needs to in order to know who's RelationshipTemplate it is (e.g. company name, address, ...), as ask for Attributes of the user you need to know in the Relationship, or send some information you already know about the user, so it can be saved in its wallet (e.g. the customer id). |
| onExistingRelationship | [`Request`](#request) \| `undefined` | The Request that should pop up to the user in case a Relationship already exists. An example usage is a Request with an `AuthenticationRequestItem` for the sake of two-factor authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### ArbitraryRelationshipTemplateContent

When communicating with a Connector, you can send any kind of data in a [RelationshipTemplate](#relationshiptemplate) by using the `ArbitraryRelationshipTemplateContent`.

| Name  | Type                                     | Description                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| @type | `"ArbitraryRelationshipTemplateContent"` |                                                |
| value | `unknown`                                | Feel free to insert whatever you want or need. |

## RelationshipCreationContent

Theoretically you can send any kind of data in a [Relationship's](#relationship) `creationContent`. However, if the [RelationshipTemplate's](#relationshiptemplate) `content` was of type `RelationshipTemplateContent`, the `creationContent` must be of type `RelationshipCreationContent`, containing the Response to the [Request](#request) contained within the [RelationshipTemplateContent's](#relationshiptemplatecontent) `onNewRelationship` property.

| Name     | Type                            | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @type    | `"RelationshipCreationContent"` |                                                                                                                                                          |
| response | [`Response`](#response)         | The Response to the Request that was contained in the [RelationshipTemplateContent](#relationshiptemplatecontent) (in the `onNewRelationship` property). |

### ArbitraryRelationshipCreationContent

When receiving a [RelationshipTemplate](#relationshiptemplate) with an [ArbitraryRelationshipTemplateContent](#arbitraryrelationshiptemplatecontent) as a Connector, any kind of data can be sent as `creationContent` of a [Relationship](#relationship) by using the `ArbitraryRelationshipCreationContent`.

| Name  | Type                                     | Description                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| @type | `"ArbitraryRelationshipCreationContent"` |                                                |
| value | `unknown`                                | Feel free to insert whatever you want or need. |

## Mail

A Mail can be sent as the content of a [Message](#message). It is comparable with the classic email, so its properties should not contain any surprise.

| Name    | Type                      | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @type   | `"Mail"`                  |                                                                                                             |
| to      | `string[]`                | The enmeshed Addresses of the main recipients of this Mail.                                                 |
| cc      | `string[]` \| `undefined` | The enmeshed Addresses that should receive a copy of this Mail, additionally to the ones specified in `to`. |
| subject | `string`                  | The subject of the Mail.                                                                                    |
| body    | `string`                  | The body of the Mail.                                                                                       |

## ArbitraryMessageContent

When communicating with a Connector, you can send any kind of data in a [Message](#message) by using the `ArbitraryMessageContent`.

| Name  | Type                        | Description                                    |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| @type | `"ArbitraryMessageContent"` |                                                |
| value | `unknown`                   | Feel free to insert whatever you want or need. |

# Consumption

## DecideRequestItemParameters

In order to answer a Request, the Response must be formulated appropriately.
As an easier interface to do so various `DecideRequestItemParameters` are provided.
If you want to reject any RequestItem, you must use the `RejectRequestItemParameters`.
If you want to accept a RequestItem, however, depending on its kind you might need different parameters.
For example, an AuthenticationRequestItem can be accepted using the AcceptRequestItemParameters, but for a FreeTextRequestItem `AcceptFreeTextRequestItemParameters` are required.
