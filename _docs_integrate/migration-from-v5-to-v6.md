The [Runtime](https://github.com/nmshd/runtime) of enmeshed has recently been updated from version 5 to version 6.
Accordingly, a new version of the [Connector](https://github.com/nmshd/connector) has also been released to make the updated Runtime available to Integrators of Connectors.
The version update has resulted in some breaking changes.
To support the migration of existing systems to the new version, the breaking changes made are listed and explained in this migration guide.
