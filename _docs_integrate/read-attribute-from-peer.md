There are many situations in which an Identity is interested in an [IdentityAttribute]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#identityattribute) or a [RelationshipAttribute]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#relationshipattribute) of another Identity, for example:

- A company must know the age of a customer in order to carry out an age check if they want to purchase alcohol or other age-restricted goods.
- A company needs the street address of a customer so that it can send them an invoice after the customer has made a purchase from the company.
- An organization is interested in the birth date of a member so that it can wish them a happy birthday every year.
- A university needs to know the email address of a student in order to be able to send them emails.

In this guide, we explain how a Connector, hereinafter referred to as the Sender, can read an [Attribute]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#attributes) of another Connector, the so-called Recipient. Since understanding this reading process requires knowledge about [Requests]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#request) and how to use them in general, you should take a look at our [Request and Response introduction]({% link _docs_integrate/request-and-response-introduction.md %}) before continuing reading this guide.

Please note that the general procedure is the same if the Connector wants to read an Attribute of an App user instead of another Connector. For reasons of clarity, this guide focuses on the reading process with two Connectors.

## Request for reading Attributes

The Sender wants to read an Attribute of the Recipient. To do this, the Sender must first create a suitable Request, which it can then send to the Recipient. In the following subsections, we describe the general appearance of a Request for reading Attributes.

### Role of ReadAttributeRequestItem

For reading a single Attribute, the Sender needs to insert a single RequestItem of type [ReadAttributeRequestItem]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#readattributerequestitem) into the `items` property of the [Request]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#request). The input it has to provide for the `query` property of the ReadAttributeRequestItem depends on what type of Attribute it wants to get. If the Sender wants to read an IdentityAttribute, it can use an appropriate [IdentityAttributeQuery]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#identityattributequery). If it is interested in a RelationshipAttribute of the Recipient, it can insert a [RelationshipAttributeQuery]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#relationshipattributequery) or a [ThirdPartyRelationshipAttributeQuery]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#thirdpartyrelationshipattributequery) at this point. This depends on whether the Sender wants to read a RelationshipAttribute that the Recipient has in the context of a [Relationship]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#relationship) with the Sender or with a third party. It is also permitted to specify an [IQLQuery]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#iqlquery) for the `query` property of the ReadAttributeRequestItem.

### Combinations and usage scenarios of ReadAttributeRequestItem

The following table provides an overview of the possible kinds of Attributes that the Sender can read from the Recipient using the ReadAttributeRequestItem. It must be taken into account whether the [Attribute]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#attributes) is an IdentityAttribute or a RelationshipAttribute and which Identity is its `owner`. If the Sender wants to read a RelationshipAttribute from the Recipient, a distinction must be made between which Identities the Relationship in question exists.

| Attribute Type | Attribute Owner | Third Party | Possible? | Automation                                                   | Examples/Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------- | :-------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identity       | Sender          |             |     ✗     | `N/A`                                                        | It makes no sense to read own IdentityAttributes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Identity       | Recipient       |             |     ✓     | `USER_DECISION`                                              | Company asks customer for its delivery address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Relationship   | Sender          |             |     ✓     | `USER_DECISION`                                              | With this combination the **Sender gives the Recipient the one-time permission** to write a RelationshipAttribute once.<br>Example: Electricity provider asks new customers for electricity meter number.                                                                                          |
| Relationship   | Recipient       |             |     ✓     | `USER_DECISION`                                              | With this combination the **Sender asks the Recipient for the one-time permission** to write a RelationshipAttribute.<br>Example: Company asks new customer to subscribe to the newsletter.                                                                                                        |
| Relationship   | Recipient       | Third Party |     ✓     | `USER DECISION / NOT ALLOWED` - depending on confidentiality | With this combination the **Sender requests a RelationshipAttribute from a Relationship between the Recipient and a third party that is owned by the Recipient.**<br> Example: A social network asks for Facebook privacy settings of a user to get senseful defaults of its own privacy settings. |
| Relationship   | Third Party     | Third Party |     ✓     | `USER DECISION / NOT ALLOWED` - depending on confidentiality | With this combination the **Sender requests a RelationshipAttribute from a Relationship between the Recipient and a third party that is owned by the third party.**<br> Example: An online shop asks for the Payback customer ID of a user to book the order on their account.                     |

### Example of reading an IdentityAttribute

We assume that the Sender wants to read an IdentityAttribute of type [EMailAddress]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-values.md %}#emailaddress) of the Recipient. To do this, it inserts the corresponding IdentityAttributeQuery into the `query` property of the [ReadAttributeRequestItem]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#readattributerequestitem), which is contained within the `items` property of the [Request]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#request) for reading Attributes. In our example, we have chosen to set the value of the `mustBeAccepted` property of the ReadAttributeRequestItem to `true`.

```jsonc
{
  "@type": "Request",
  "items": [
    {
      "@type": "ReadAttributeRequestItem",
      "mustBeAccepted": true,
      "query": {
        "@type": "IdentityAttributeQuery",
        "valueType": "EMailAddress"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example of reading a RelationshipAttribute

We now consider the case that the Sender has an active Relationship established with the Recipient and that the Sender wants to request a [RelationshipAttribute]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#relationshipattribute) of this Relationship whose `value` is set by the Recipient. Then the associated [ReadAttributeRequestItem]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#readattributerequestitem), which is contained in the `items` property of the [Request]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#request) for reading Attributes created by the Sender, must contain an appropriate RelationshipAttributeQuery in its `query` property. For example, if the Sender wants to request a RelationshipAttribute of type [ProprietaryString]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-values.md %}#proprietarystring) that is owned by the Recipient and whose `confidentiality` is `"public"`, the Request could look like this:

```jsonc
{
  "@type": "Request",
  "items": [
    {
      "@type": "ReadAttributeRequestItem",
      "mustBeAccepted": true,
      "query": {
        "@type": "RelationshipAttributeQuery",
        "key": "<key of RelationshipAttribute>",
        "owner": "<Address of Recipient>",
        "attributeCreationHints": {
          "title": "<title of RelationshipAttribute>",
          "valueType": "ProprietaryString",
          "confidentiality": "public"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the `<...>` notation is used as a placeholder for the actual data as usual. Further details on the purposes for which you can use a RelationshipAttributeQuery can be found in the table of the [Combinations and usage scenarios of the ReadAttributeRequestItem]({% link _docs_integrate/read-attribute-from-peer.md %}#combinations-and-usage-scenarios-of-readattributerequestitem). For information on using the ThirdPartyRelationshipAttributeQuery, you should also refer to this table.

### Read multiple Attributes

Requesting read access is not limited to just a single Attribute, but it is possible to request read access to multiple Attributes at the same time. Several ReadAttributeRequestItems or suitable [RequestItemGroups]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#requestitemgroup) can be inserted into the `items` property of the [Request]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#request) for reading Attributes for this purpose. If you want to use a RequestItemGroup in order to request read access to multiple Attributes of the Recipient at the same time, you must insert corresponding ReadAttributeRequestItems into the `items` property of it.

## Send and receive the Request

The Sender that wants to read an Attribute of the Recipient may or may not already have a Relationship with the Recipient. Depending on which is the case, a different method can be used to send the [Request for reading Attributes]({% link _docs_integrate/read-attribute-from-peer.md %}#request-for-reading-attributes). There are two ways to send the Request for reading Attributes created by the Sender to the Recipient.

### Request over Template

If there is currently no Relationship between the Sender and the Recipient, this approach must be used. But it is also possible for the Sender to use a [RelationshipTemplate]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#relationshiptemplate) to send a Request to the Recipient if there is already an active Relationship between them. All details on how to send and receive a Request via a RelationshipTemplate in general can be found in the [Requests over Templates]({% link _docs_integrate/requests-over-templates.md %}) guide.

### Request over Message

The Sender only has the option of sending a Request to the Recipient via a [Message]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#message) if there is already an active Relationship between them. All information on how to send and receive a Request via a Message can be found in the [Requests over Messages]({% link _docs_integrate/requests-over-messages.md %}) guide.

## Accept the Request

After the Recipient has received the [Request for reading Attributes]({% link _docs_integrate/read-attribute-from-peer.md %}#request-for-reading-attributes), it can accept it to give the Sender read access to all or some of the requested Attributes. To do this, proceed as described in the [Accept incoming Request]({% link _docs_use-cases/use-case-consumption-accept-incoming-request.md %}) use case documentation and specify the `id` of the received [Request]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#request). You must also decide and specify for each ReadAttributeRequestItem and RequestItemGroup contained in the Request for reading Attributes whether you want to accept or reject it.

If the Recipient does not want the Sender to read any of its Attributes and, therefore, does not want to accept the Request for reading Attributes of the Sender, it can reject it as a whole as well. For this, follow the instructions of the [Reject incoming Request]({% link _docs_use-cases/use-case-consumption-reject-incoming-request.md %}) use case.
{: .notice--info}

<div style="width: 640px; height: 480px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:640px; height:480px" src="https://lucid.app/documents/embedded/164e1c68-0997-4a16-832c-c1e53bb55571" id="NypRt8MoA-HR"></iframe></div>

### Accept a ReadAttributeRequestItem

If the Recipient agrees to share a requested Attribute with the Sender, it can accept the associated ReadAttributeRequestItem contained in the Request for reading Attributes. In particular, it must then provide the requested Attribute for its Response to the Request. Depending on whether the Recipient wants to share an Attribute that already exists as a [LocalAttribute]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#localattribute) or that has to be created first, different parameters for this must be used. These [AcceptReadAttributeRequestItemParameters]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#acceptreadattributerequestitemparameters) are described in the corresponding section of the Data Model Overview. The acceptance of a ReadAttributeRequestItem always leads to the creation of a LocalAttribute with a [LocalAttributeShareInfo]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#localattributeshareinfo) contained within its `shareInfo` property, whose underlying `content` is given by the shared Attribute. An appropriate AcceptResponseItem of type [ReadAttributeAcceptResponseItem]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#readattributeacceptresponseitem) is generated, which incorporates the `id` of the LocalAttribute with the LocalAttributeShareInfo in its `attributeId` property and the shared Attribute in its `attribute` property. This ReadAttributeAcceptResponseItem will be included in the `items` property of the [Response]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#response) to the Request for reading Attributes that will be transferred to the Sender. If a new IdentityAttribute is to be shared, a corresponding LocalAttribute without a LocalAttributeShareInfo is additionally created for the Recipient beforehand.

### Reject a ReadAttributeRequestItem

Even if the Recipient accepts the Request for reading Attributes as a whole, it may decide not to share every requested Attribute with the Sender. To be more precise, the Recipient has the option of rejecting [ReadAttributeRequestItems]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#readattributerequestitem) that have the value `false` specified in their `mustBeAccepted` property. To reject a ReadAttributeRequestItem, use the [RejectRequestItemParameters]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#rejectrequestitemparameters). The rejection of a ReadAttributeRequestItem leads to the creation of a ResponseItem of type [RejectResponseItem]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#rejectresponseitem). This will be contained within the `items` property of the [Response]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#response) to the Request for reading Attributes.

### Example of accepting a RequestItemGroup

Let's look at an example where the Sender is interested in the Recipient's [BirthDate]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-values.md %}#birthdate) and contact information in the form of an [EMailAddress]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-values.md %}#emailaddress) or a [PhoneNumber]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-values.md %}#phonenumber). To ask the Recipient for this data, the Sender creates a [Request]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#request) for reading Attributes, which contains a ReadAttributeRequestItem belonging to the BirthDate and a RequestItemGroup belonging to the contact information in its `items` property. The [RequestItemGroup]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#requestitemgroup) itself contains two ReadAttributeRequestItems in its `items` property, namely one for the EMailAddress and one for the PhoneNumber.

```jsonc
{
  "@type": "Request",
  "items": [
    {
      "@type": "ReadAttributeRequestItem",
      "mustBeAccepted": false,
      "query": {
        "@type": "IdentityAttributeQuery",
        "valueType": "BirthDate"
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "RequestItemGroup",
      "mustBeAccepted": true,
      "items": [
        {
          "@type": "ReadAttributeRequestItem",
          "mustBeAccepted": true,
          "query": {
            "@type": "IdentityAttributeQuery",
            "valueType": "EMailAddress"
          }
        },
        {
          "@type": "ReadAttributeRequestItem",
          "mustBeAccepted": false,
          "query": {
            "@type": "IdentityAttributeQuery",
            "valueType": "PhoneNumber"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In our example, the Sender only requires the Recipient to share its EMailAddress, which is why the individual [ReadAttributeRequestItems]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#readattributerequestitem) and the [RequestItemGroup]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#requestitemgroup) within the Request have specified corresponding values in their `mustBeAccepted` property. We assume that the Recipient wants to accept the Request and only wants to share its EMailAddress, which is already saved as an appropriate LocalAttribute, with the Sender.

If the Recipient wants to accept the Request for reading Attributes, it must accept all ReadAttributeRequestItems for which the `mustBeAccepted` property is set to `true`. It is therefore not permitted, for example, for the Recipient to refuse to share its EMailAddress and instead share its PhoneNumber.
{: .notice--info}

The Recipient refuses to share its BirthDate with the Sender and accepts at least one ReadAttributeRequestItem of the RequestItemGroup. Also, the Recipient accepts the sharing of its EMailAddress and rejects the sharing of its PhoneNumber. Thus, it responds to the Request for reading Attributes as follows:

```jsonc
{
  "items": [
    {
      // Reject sharing of BirthDate
      "accept": false
    },
    {
      // Accept RequestItemGroup
      "accept": true,
      "items": [
        {
          // Accept sharing of existing EMailAddress
          "accept": true,
          "existingAttributeId": "<ID of LocalAttribute of EMailAddress>"
        },
        {
          // Reject sharing of PhoneNumber
          "accept": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that it is important to respond to RequestItems and RequestItemGroups in the same order in which they were received.

## Get the Attributes

We now assume that the Recipient has accepted the [Request for reading Attributes]({% link _docs_integrate/read-attribute-from-peer.md %}#request-for-reading-attributes) of the Sender. In order for the Sender to receive the Response of the Recipient, it needs to [synchronize the updates of the Backbone]({% link _docs_use-cases/use-case-transport-synchronize-updates-of-backbone.md %}). Please note that this synchronization can also be automated by using the [Sync Module]({% link _docs_operate/modules.md %}#sync).

<div style="width: 640px; height: 480px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:640px; height:480px" src="https://lucid.app/documents/embedded/c8e5575e-ed55-48c2-897e-68e99d5df932" id="jbZRol4VVGZQ"></iframe></div>

To view the Response to the Request, search for it in the synchronization result or proceed as described in the [Query outgoing Requests]({% link _docs_use-cases/use-case-consumption-query-outgoing-requests.md %}) use case documentation and use the following query parameter:

- If the [Request was sent via a Template]({% link _docs_integrate/read-attribute-from-peer.md %}#request-over-template): Specify `<ID of RelationshipTemplate>` as the value for the `source.reference` query parameter.
- If the [Request was sent via a Message]({% link _docs_integrate/read-attribute-from-peer.md %}#request-over-message): Specify `<ID of Request>` as the value for the `id` query parameter.

The Integrator of the Sender can now get the Response of the Recipient from the `response.content` property of the result. In particular, each requested and shared Attribute that belongs to an accepted ReadAttributeRequestItem can be read from a corresponding ReadAttributeAcceptResponseItem within the `items` property of the [Response]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#response). Internally, the shared `attribute` that can be read from the [ReadAttributeAcceptResponseItem]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#readattributeacceptresponseitem) is used to create an appropriate LocalAttribute with a LocalAttributeShareInfo of the Sender. On the other hand, there is a corresponding RejectResponseItem in the `items` property of the Response for each rejected ReadAttributeRequestItem.

In case of an error, [ErrorResponseItems]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#errorresponseitem) can also be included in the Response. If the Request for reading Attributes contains a RequestItemGroup in its `items` property, the Response to this Request contains a corresponding [ResponseItemGroup]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#responseitemgroup) in its `items` property.

## What's next?

Take a look at our [Integration example]({% link _docs_integrate/integration-example.md %}) if you want to see how an Attribute of a peer is read by an Identity in the context of a larger process. Also note that it is not only possible to request the reading of an Attribute from a peer, but that you can share your own Attribute with a peer as well. Consult the [Share own Attribute to peer]({% link _docs_integrate/share-own-attribute-to-peer.md %}) guide for this.
