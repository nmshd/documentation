# Flow

enmeshed supports specific authentication requests for users, e.g. for multi-factor based logins. This is done by sending out Requests with AuthenticationRequestItems.

# Examples

- Single-factor based logins, e.g. scanning in an enmeshed QR-Code from an unknown browser window
- Multi-factor based logins, e.g. requesting the user's authentication over enmeshed after a password-based login
- Multi-factor based business processes, e.g. requesting the user's authentication if the user want to read or change certain kind of administrative information
