{% include properties_list.html %}

This use case is intended to check if a [LocalRequest]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#localrequest) can be created based on a given [Request]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#request) for a given `peer`.
This use case should be executed before actually attempting to [create the outgoing Request](use-case-consumption-create-outgoing-request), because a more precise error description is provided in the case of a faulty Request.

## Parameters

- The `content` as a [Request]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#request) for the to be created [LocalRequest]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#localrequest).
- The `peer` is the address for which the LocalRequest should be created. There can only be one peer per LocalRequest. Even though the `peer` parameter is optional, it is recommended to specify it whenever possible. This allows additional validation rules to execute. When sending a [Request via a Message]({% link _docs_integrate/requests-via-messages.md %}), the `peer` receiving it is always known.

## On Success

- Returns a `RequestValidationResult` that indicates if the given Request is valid.

## On Failure

- The `RequestValidationResult` cannot be created if the Request specified as `content` is malformed.
