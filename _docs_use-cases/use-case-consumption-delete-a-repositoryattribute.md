{{properties.description}}

{% include properties_list.html %}

This use-case allows you to delete a RepositoryAttribute, i.e. a [LocalAttribute]({%link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#localattribute) that is owned by yourself and whose `shareInfo` property is undefined.

## Parameters

- The `attributeId` of the RepositoryAttribute you want to delete.

## On Success

- The RepositoryAttribute will be deleted.
- All predecessors of the RepositoryAttribute will be deleted.
- If the RepositoryAttribute was succeeded, the `succeeds` property of the successor will be set to undefined.
- If there are shared copies of the RepositoryAttribute or potential predecessors of it, the `shareInfo.sourceAttribute` of those own shared Attributes will be set to undefined.

## On Failure

- No Attribute can be deleted if you don't have a LocalAttribute with given `attributeId`.
- No Attribute can be deleted if the Attribute with given `attributeId` is not a RepositoryAttribute.
