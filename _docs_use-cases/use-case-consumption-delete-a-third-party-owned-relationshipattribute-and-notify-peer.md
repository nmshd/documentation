{% include properties_list.html %}

This use case allows you to delete a third party owned RelationshipAttribute, i.e. a [LocalAttribute]({%link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#localattribute) that exists in a Relationship with a peer, but is not owned by you or this peer but by a third party.

## Parameters

- The `attributeId` of the third party owned RelationshipAttribute you want to delete.

## On Success

- The third party owned RelationshipAttribute will be deleted.
- All predecessors of the third party owned RelationshipAttribute will be deleted.
- If the third party owned RelationshipAttribute was succeeded, the `succeeds` property of the successor will be set to undefined.
- If there are shared copies of the third party owned RelationshipAttribute or potential predecessors of it, the `shareInfo.sourceAttribute` of those copied third party owned RelationshipAttributes will be set to undefined.
- A [Notification]({%link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#notification) with a [ThirdPartyOwnedRelationshipAttributeDeletedByPeerNotificationItem]({%link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#thirdpartyownedrelationshipattributedeletedbypeernotificationitem) is sent to the peer of the Attribute, informing them that you deleted the Attribute. Technically, the Attribute of the peer and all predecessors will get a `deletionInfo` with `deletionStatus` `"DeletedByPeer"` and the time of receiving the Notification as `deletionDate`.
- The `notificationId` is returned.

## On Failure

- No Attribute can be deleted if you don't have a LocalAttribute with given `attributeId`.
- No Attribute can be deleted if the Attribute with given `attributeId` is not a third party owned RelationshipAttribute.
