This use-case allows the owner to update a [RelationshipAttribute]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#relationshipattribute), while automatically handling the coherent versioning at both your and your peer's side.
[Succeeding an own RelationshipAttribute]({% link _docs_integrate/update-attributes-by-succession.md %}#succeeding-own-relationshipattributes), a new [LocalAttribute]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#localattribute) with the updated `content` will be created at your side.
In its `succeeds` property it links to the predecessing version, which in turn is also updated and links to the newly created version in its `succeededBy` property.
Thus, a doubly linked list is established, ensuring every version to have not more that one predecessor or successor.
Once the succession at your side is completed, a [Notification]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#notification) is sent automatically to your peer.
It triggers the succession of their peer shared RelationshipAttribute in the same manner as described above, such that both your succession chains match.

## Parameters

- `predecessorId`: the `id` of the LocalAttribute with the RelationshipAttribute `content` you want to succeed
- The updated `successorContent` limited to the `value`, `validFrom` and `validTo` properties of a [RelationshipAttribute]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#relationshipattribute) that may be changed by a succession

## On Success

- The response returns a `predecessor` and a `successor` LocalAttribute, as well as the `notificationId` of the Notification sent to the peer.
- The `predecessor` is an updated version of the own shared RelationshipAttribute, having the `succeededBy` field set to the `successor`'s `id`.
- The `successor` is a new own shared RelationshipAttribute version with the specified `successorContent`. Its `succeeds` property links to the `predecessor`.

## On Failure

- The response cannot be created, if the `predecessorId` doesn't belong to a valid own LocalAttribute with RelationshipAttribute `content`.
- The response cannot be created, if the LocalAttribute belonging to the `predecessorId` already has a successor.
- The response cannot be created, if the parameters are malformed.
