{% include properties_list.html %}

[Initiating a Relationship]({% link _docs_integrate/establish-relationships.md %}#initiate-a-relationship) leads to the creation of a [Relationship]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#relationship) with `"Pending"` as `status`.
With this use case, the other involved Identity can accept the pending Relationship with the given Relationship's `id`.
As a result, the `status` of the Relationship changes from `"Pending"` to `"Active"`.

## Parameters

- `relationshipId`, the `id` of the Relationship

## On Success

- Accepts the pending Relationship
- Returns the accepted Relationship

## On Failure

- The `relationshipId` does not resolve to a pending Relationship
- You have tried to accept a Relationship created by yourself
