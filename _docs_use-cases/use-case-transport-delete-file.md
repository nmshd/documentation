{{properties.description}}

{% include properties_list.html %}

This use case allows you to delete a [File]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#file).

## Parameters

- `id` of the File that should be deleted.

## On Success

- The File is deleted locally.
- If `isOwn` of the [File]({% link _docs_integrate/data-model-overview.md %}#file) is `true`, the File will be deleted from the Backbone, too.

## On Failure

- No File can be deleted if there is no File that corresponds to the given `id`.
