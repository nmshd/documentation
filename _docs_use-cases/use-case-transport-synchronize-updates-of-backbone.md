{{properties.description}}

{% include properties_list.html %}

Be advised that calling this use case to sync the Identity/Device on a regular basis is discouraged.
Please configure the [Server-Sent Events Module]({% link _docs_operate/modules.md %}#sse) or [Sync Module]({% link _docs_operate/modules.md %}#sync) to automate the synchronization.
{: .notice--warning}

This use case retrieves all relevant data changes between the current Identity (and Device) and the Backbone since the last synchronization. The relevant data so far are new Messages, new/changed Relationships and new/changed IdentityDeletionProcesses.
For example, this also includes the receipt of new reactivation requests of terminated Relationships and new responses to those requests, even if they do not change the `status` of the Relationship.

## On Success

- Relevant data changes are received internally, but no response body associated with the data changes is returned.
