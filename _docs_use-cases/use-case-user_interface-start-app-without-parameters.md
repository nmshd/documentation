{{properties.description}}

{% include properties_list.html %}

Be advised that this is an App-specific use case which is triggered without a user interaction. Although it is a very generic use case which one would normally not describe, we introduced it because we require it in our overarching scenarios.
{: .notice--info}

This use case triggers the opening of the App without any parameters, like a user presses the App's icon on the home screen.
