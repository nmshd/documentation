A request can combine several requests into one.

Several requests can be included in the array as items for this purpose. Another option is to include a RequestItemGroup in this item list, which contains an item array in which various requests can be listed.

The entire request is displayed in the wallet at once and accepted as a complete construct. This means that all necessary fields from all requests must be filled in the complex request.
