The enmeshed data model can be divided into three parts:

- Transport types
- Local types
- Content types

The following diagram gives you an overview of all the existing types and how they are connected to each other. The subsequent chapters describe these types in more detail.

(note that you can click on each type in order to navigate to the paragraph with the corresponding description)

At a first glance the amount of types is overwhelming. But in the following chapters all of them are explained in detail.

# Transport Types

Transport types like `RelationshipTemplate`, `Token` or `File` are types that are "exchanged" between Identities via the Backbone. They are created and updated by the [Transport Layer]({% link _docs_explore/42-transport-layer.md %}). In most cases they have a `content` property, which contains the actual payload that should be transferred between the Identities. This payload is being encrypted when it is sent to the Backbone, and decrypted by the other Identity when it is received. The following sections describe the different Transport types and their properties.

Note that the properties of the types are the ones that exist locally (aka on the Connector/in the App). The Backbone does not necessarily know about them. The properties that only exist locally are marked accordingly in the tables below. Further there are properties that are confidential and are therefore encrypted before sent to the Backbone, in order to enable end-to-end encryption. Both kinds of these properties are marked accordingly in the "Remarks" column of the property tables below.

## Token

Tokens can be used to save arbitrary structured data on the Backbone, which is encrypted with a random symmetric key. You can then pass the ID of the Token, together with the random key, to another Identity, which can then retrieve the token and decrypt it, e.g. inside of a QR Code, which you send to the recipient via letter. Tokens can be handy in a lot of scenarios, for example:

- You want to share secret information with someone you don't have a Relationship with.
- The enmeshed App currently uses a Token to save a Backup of the Identity. ID and secret key are then encoded in a QR Code, which the user can print out and scan later in order to restore the Identity on a new device.

A Token has the following properties:

| isEphemeral        | `boolean` | If set to `true` the Token will not be cached in the database and only displayed once. You will not be able to fetch this Token unless you remember its id and secretKey. |

## RelationshipTemplate

A Relationship Template serves two purposes:

1. It represents the permission to establish a Relationship. When sending a Relationship request, the sender has to attach the ID of a valid Relationship Template created by the recipient. Otherwise the Backbone blocks the Relationship request. And since the IDs are randomly generated, you can only obtain such an ID from the recipient.
2. It can contain data which is of interest for the one who uses the Relationship Template. The enmeshed App for example expects a Relationship Template content which contains a `Request` which contains e.g. Attributes about the creator of the Template as well as queries for Attributes that the Template creator wants to receive together with the Relationship request.

## Relationship

A Relationship between two Identities is the prerequisite for them to exchange Messages. If there is no Relationship, the Backbone blocks all Messages that are tried to be sent. This ensures that you only receive Messages from Identities you know, so you are protected from any harmful Messages like spam or phishing mails.

### RelationshipChange

Since a Relationship "belongs" to two Identities, each change on such a Relationship demands for the agreement of both parties. That's where Relationship Changes come into play. Whenever one party wants to make a change to the Relationship (like create or terminate it), it sends a Relationship Change to the other party, which has to accept it in order for the change to take effect. If the other party doesn't want to accept it, it can also reject it. And if the party that created the Relationship Change changes its mind, it can revoke the Relationship Change. The Backbone makes sure that a Relationship Change can only be completed in one of those three ways (accepted, rejected, revoked). So for example if you try to accept a Relationship Change that is already revoked, you will receive an error.

## Message

A Message is a piece of data that can be sent to one or more recipients. The sender is completely free in what the content of the Message looks like. Though in order to enable a normalized communication, enmeshed defines some content structures for Messages, and in the future there will be more of those. Consider that the enmeshed App only supports those normalized Message contents. Currently there are:

- [`Mail`](#mail)
- [`Request`](#request)
- [`ResponseWrapper`](#responsewrapper)

You can read more details about each of these in the corresponding sections of the "Content Types" chapter.

But if you are communicating with another Connector, feel free to settle on any content structure that fits your needs.

| receivedByDevice | `string` \| `undefined` | The ID of the Device that first retrieved the Message. `undefined` when the Message wasn't received yet. This is of no interest for the sender of the Message, but rather for the recipient itself, since they can use it for audit purposes. sender |                    |

## File

The Backbone allows you to upload files, which are saved as - you guessed it - `Files`.

| Name               | Type                    | Description                                                                                                           | Remarks                                       |

A File further has its content, of course. But since this is not a JSON property, it is not included in this table. You can download the content of the File separately.

# Local Types

In addition to the types that are shared between Identities via the Backbone, there are certain types that only exist within one Identity. These types usually contain metadata about [Content types](#content-types) that should not be transferred to other Identities. They are created and updated by the [Consumption Layer]({% link _docs_explore/43-consumption-layer.md %}).

Currently there are three main Local types:

- LocalRequest
- LocalNotification
- LocalAttribute

Each of them further describes some sub types.

This chapter explains all of those types, together with their properties.

## LocalRequest

A LocalRequest contains the local metadata for a [Request](#request).

| Name      | Type                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id        | `string`                                                   | {% include descr_id class="LocalRequest" prefix="REQ" %}                                                                                     |
| isOwn     | `boolean`                                                  | `true` if you sent the Request, `false` if you received it.                                                                                  |
| peer      | `string`                                                   | The Identity that sent you the corresponding Request/that you sent the Request to.                                                           |
| createdAt | `string`                                                   | {% include descr_createdAt class="LocalRequest" %}                                                                                           |
| status    | [`LocalRequestStatus`](#localrequeststatus)                | The current status of the Request. See [below](#localrequeststatus) for a list of all possible values.                                       |
| content   | [`Request`](#request)                                      | The actual Content object this LocalRequest defines the metadata for.                                                                        |
| source    | [`LocalRequestSource`](#localrequestsource) \| `undefined` | Information about the Transport object with which the Request came in/was sent. This property is `undefined` if the Request is not sent yet. |
| response  | [`LocalResponse`](#localresponse) \| `undefined`           | Metadata + Content object of the response. If there is no response yet, this property is `undefined`.                                        |

### LocalRequestStatus

Depending on whether it is an incoming or an outgoing Request, there can be different statuses. The following state diagram shows which status exists in both cases and when there are transitions from one state to another:

![State diagram for LocalRequest Status]( {{ '/assets/images/explore/RequestStatus%20-%20State%20Diagram.png' | relative_url }} )

Draft
: This status only exists for outgoing Requests. It means that the LocalRequest was created, but not yet sent.

Open
: In case of an outgoing Request, `Open` means that the Request was sent. The transition to `Open` happens automatically when you send the Request with a Message.
: In case of an incoming Request, `Open` means that the LocalRequest was received.

DecisionRequired
: After the prerequisites of the Request and all of its RequestItems were checked, a decision can be made. At first, the [Decider Module]({% link _docs_explore/61-runtime.md %}#decider-module) tries to make an automatic decision. It therefore checks all LocalRequests in status `DecisionRequired`.

ManualDecisionRequired
: If the Decider Module cannot make a decision, it moves the LocalRequest to `ManualDecisionRequired`. When the LocalRequest is in this status, it's the User's turn to decide whether they want to accept or reject the Request.

Decided
: When the User or the Decider Module accepts or rejects the Request, the Response and ResponseItems are generated based on the passed parameters. This Response is saved in the `response` property of the `LocalRequest`, but not yet sent.

Completed
: In case of an incoming Request, the Runtime Module listens to an Event saying that a Request moved to status `Decided`. It then checks on which way the Request was received (Message/RelationshipTemplate) and sends the Response on the corresponding way (by sending a message or creating a Relationship). After the Response was successfully sent, it moves the LocalRequest to `Completed`.
: In case of an outgoing Request, the Runtime Module listens to the `MessageReceivedEvent` and checks the content of the sent Message for a Response. If there is one, it moves the corresponding LocalRequest to `Completed`.

Expired
: When the timestamp in `expiresAt` of a Request is reached, the Request automatically moves to the status `Expired`.

### LocalRequestSource

With the information in this type you can clearly identify the Transport object the Request was sent/received in. Currently there are only two possibilities: Message and Relationship Template.

| Name      | Type                                | Description                                                      |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type      | "Message" \| "RelationshipTemplate" | The type of Transport object the Request was sent/received in.   |
| reference | `string`                            | The ID of the Transport object the Request was sent/received in. |

### LocalResponse

When a LocalRequest is decided/received, a Local Response is generated, which contains the Response, together with some metadata.

| Name      | Type                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| createdAt | `string`                                                     | {% include descr_createdAt class="LocalResponse" %}                                                                                                     |
| content   | [`Response`](#response)                                      | The actual Content object this Local Response defines the metadata for.                                                                                 |
| source    | [`LocalResponseSource`](#localresponsesource) \| `undefined` | Information about the Transport object with which the Response came in/was sent. This property is `undefined` if the Response is not sent/received yet. |

### LocalResponseSource

With the information in this type you can clearly identify the Transport object the Response was sent/received in. Currently there are only two possibilities: Message and Relationship Change.

| Name      | Type                              | Description                                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type      | "Message" \| "RelationshipChange" | The type of Transport object the Response was sent/received in.   |
| reference | `string`                          | The ID of the Transport object the Response was sent/received in. |

## LocalNotification

A LocalNotification contains the local metadata for a [Notification](#notification).

| Name             | Type                                                  | Description                                                                                                                             |

| isOwn            | `boolean`                                             | `true` if you sent the Notification, `false` if you received it.                                                                        |
| peer             | `string`                                              | The Identity that sent you the corresponding Notification/that you sent the Notification to.                                            |
| createdAt        | `string`                                              | {% include descr_createdAt class="LocalNotification" %}                                                                                 |

### LocalNotificationStatus

Depending on whether it is an incoming or an outgoing Notification, there can be different statuses.

Sent
: This is the only valid status on sender side. If a Notification is sent and, therefore, a LocalNotification is created, its status will be set to `Sent`.

Open
: Receiving a Notification, a LocalNotification is created with status `Open`.

Completed
: After receiving a Notification, its items will be processed internally. If all processes finish successfully, the status of the LocalNotification will be set to `Completed`.

Error
: If an error occurs while processing the items of a received Notification, the status of the LocalNotification will be set to `Error`.

### LocalNotificationSource

With the information in this type you can clearly identify the Transport object the Notification was sent/received in. Currently, the only possibility for transmitting Notifications are Messages.

## LocalAttribute

A LocalAttribute contains the local metadata for an [Attribute](#attributes). There are three situations a LocalAttribute is created in the database:

- The Identity maintains an Attribute about itself (e.g. sets its first name). We call such a LocalAttribute "RepositoryAttribute".
- The Identity shares an Attribute of itself with another Identity (e.g. sends it in a Request). In that case, a _copy of the original LocalAttribute_ is created, where the `shareInfo` property is set.
- The Identity receives an Attribute from another Identity (e.g. receives it in a Request). In that case a _new LocalAttribute_ is created, where the `shareInfo` is set.

### LocalAttributeShareInfo

The LocalAttributeShareInfo helps to keep track of how the LocalAttribute was received/sent, from whom it was received/who sent it, as well as which LocalAttribute it was copied from (in case of a shared IdentityAttribute). For example, this enables us to track back who we shared a certain IdentityAttribute with, so we are able to notify each of them when changing it. The Attribute can be either transmitted via Request or Notification. Hence, only one of `requestReference` and `notificationReference` can be set.

| requestReference      | `string` \| `undefined` | The ID of the [LocalRequest](#localrequest) the LocalAttribute was received in/sent with. If this is set, `notificationReference` must be undefined.      |
| notificationReference | `string` \| `undefined` | The ID of the [LocalNotification](#localnotification) the LocalAttribute was received in/sent with. If this is set, `requestReference` must be undefined. |
| sourceAttribute       | `string` \| `undefined` | If the LocalAttribute is a copy of a RepositoryAttribute, then this property contains the `id` of the RepositoryAttribute.                                |

## LocalAttributeListener

A LocalAttributeListener is created when you accept an incoming Request with a [`RegisterAttributeListenerRequestItem`](#registerattributelistenerrequestitem). It is used to keep track of which Attribute Listeners currently exist and what they are listening for.

# Content Types

Content Types can be seen as a data contract between Identities. The medium through which this data is exchanged are the [Transport types](#transport-types) (e.g. Messages, Tokens, ...). This chapter shows all the Content types and describes their intended usage.

## Request

A Request allows you to ask another Identity to do something. What this "something" is depends on which of the so called [RequestItems](#requestitems) were added to the Request (e.g. [`CreateAttributeRequestItem`](}#createattributerequestitem), [`ReadAttributeRequestItem`](#readattributerequestitem), ...). The Request is then sent to the peer via Message or Relationship Template. The peer can then review the Request and decide whether they want to accept or reject it. And if they accept it, they can even choose which of the Items they want to accept. You can also put multiple Items into a [group](#requestitemgroup) in order to ensure that they can only be accepted/rejected as a unit.

### RequestItems

RequestItems can be sent inside of a Request and specify what should be done when the Request is accepted.

| metadata              | `object` \| `undefined`       | The metadata property can be used to provide arbitrary JSON content by the sender of the request. The metadata is not processed by enmeshed. It is a great way to use your own process descriptors at the time of sending the request which helps you identify the correct internal process at the time of receiving the response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| mustBeAccepted        | `boolean`                     | The mandatory mustBeAccepted property is used to differentiate between required and optional RequestItems within the Request. In other words, if the peer Identity may or may not decide to ignore this specific RequestItem. If set to true, the peer cannot accept the Request without accepting this item. For example, some Attributes are mandatory for the business process and thus the respective RequestItems must be accepted (mustBeAccepted = true). A consent to a newsletter is optional and thus only can be accepted (mustBeAccepted = false). Keep in mind that if the RequestItem is inside of a RequestItem Group, then this flag takes effect only when the Group is accepted. So as long as the Group is not accepted, the Item does not have to be accepted either. |
| requireManualDecision | `boolean` \| `undefined`      | To block the automated acceptance of Requests, the requireManualDecision property can be set to true. The default is, that each RequestItem may be automatically processed on the peer side. If the sender would like to have an enforced manual acceptance step the requireManualDecision property can be set to true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| metadata              | `object` \| `undefined`  | The metadata property can be used to provide arbitrary JSON content by the sender of the request. The metadata is not processed by enmeshed. It is a great way to use your own process descriptors at the time of sending the request which helps you identify the correct internal process at the time of receiving the response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| mustBeAccepted        | `boolean`                | The mandatory mustBeAccepted property is used to differentiate between required and optional RequestItems within the Request. In other words, if the peer Identity may or may not decide to ignore this specific RequestItem. If set to true, the peer cannot accept the Request without accepting this item. For example, some Attributes are mandatory for the business process and thus the respective RequestItems must be accepted (mustBeAccepted = true). A consent to a newsletter is optional and thus only can be accepted (mustBeAccepted = false). Keep in mind that if the RequestItem is inside of a RequestItem Group, then this flag takes effect only when the Group is accepted. So as long as the Group is not accepted, the Item does not have to be accepted either. |
| requireManualDecision | `boolean` \| `undefined` | To block the automated acceptance of Requests, the requireManualDecision property can be set to true. The default is, that each RequestItem may be automatically processed on the peer side. If the sender would like to have an enforced manual acceptance step the requireManualDecision property can be set to true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

In other words, if the peer Identity may or may not decide to ignore this specific RequestItem. If set to true, the peer cannot accept the Request without accepting this item. For example, some Attributes are mandatory for the business process and thus the respective RequestItems must be accepted (mustBeAccepted = true). A consent to a newsletter is optional and thus only can be accepted (mustBeAccepted = false). Keep in mind that if the RequestItem is inside of a RequestItem Group, then this flag takes effect only when the Group is accepted. So as long as the Group is not accepted, the Item does not have to be accepted either. |

| metadata              | `object` \| `undefined`  | The metadata property can be used to provide arbitrary JSON content by the sender of the request. The metadata is not processed by enmeshed. It is a great way to use your own process descriptors at the time of sending the request which helps you identify the correct internal process at the time of receiving the response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| mustBeAccepted        | `boolean`                | The mandatory mustBeAccepted property is used to differentiate between required and optional RequestItems within the Request. In other words, if the peer Identity may or may not decide to ignore this specific RequestItem. If set to true, the peer cannot accept the Request without accepting this item. For example, some Attributes are mandatory for the business process and thus the respective RequestItems must be accepted (mustBeAccepted = true). A consent to a newsletter is optional and thus only can be accepted (mustBeAccepted = false). Keep in mind that if the RequestItem is inside of a RequestItem Group, then this flag takes effect only when the Group is accepted. So as long as the Group is not accepted, the Item does not have to be accepted either. |
| requireManualDecision | `boolean` \| `undefined` | To block the automated acceptance of Requests, the requireManualDecision property can be set to true. The default is, that each RequestItem may be automatically processed on the peer side. If the sender would like to have an enforced manual acceptance step the requireManualDecision property can be set to true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The metadata is not processed by enmeshed. It is a great way to use your own process descriptors at the time of sending the request which helps you identify the correct internal process at the time of receiving the response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

In other words, if the peer Identity may or may not decide to ignore this specific RequestItem. If set to true, the peer cannot accept the Request without accepting this item. For example, some Attributes are mandatory for the business process and thus the respective RequestItems must be accepted (mustBeAccepted = true). A consent to a newsletter is optional and thus only can be accepted (mustBeAccepted = false). Keep in mind that if the RequestItem is inside of a RequestItem Group, then this flag takes effect only when the Group is accepted. So as long as the Group is not accepted, the Item does not have to be accepted either. |

In other words, if the peer Identity may or may not decide to ignore this specific RequestItem. If set to true, the peer cannot accept the Request without accepting this item. For example, some Attributes are mandatory for the business process and thus the respective RequestItems must be accepted (mustBeAccepted = true). A consent to a newsletter is optional and thus only can be accepted (mustBeAccepted = false). Keep in mind that if the RequestItem is inside of a RequestItem Group, then this flag takes effect only when the Group is accepted. So as long as the Group is not accepted, the Item does not have to be accepted either. |

In other words, if the peer Identity may or may not decide to ignore this specific RequestItem. If set to true, the peer cannot accept the Request without accepting this item. For example, some Attributes are mandatory for the business process and thus the respective RequestItems must be accepted (mustBeAccepted = true). A consent to a newsletter is optional and thus only can be accepted (mustBeAccepted = false). Keep in mind that if the RequestItem is inside of a RequestItem Group, then this flag takes effect only when the Group is accepted. So as long as the Group is not accepted, the Item does not have to be accepted either. |

In other words, if the peer Identity may or may not decide to ignore this specific RequestItem. If set to true, the peer cannot accept the Request without accepting this item. For example, some Attributes are mandatory for the business process and thus the respective RequestItems must be accepted (mustBeAccepted = true). A consent to a newsletter is optional and thus only can be accepted (mustBeAccepted = false). Keep in mind that if the RequestItem is inside of a RequestItem Group, then this flag takes effect only when the Group is accepted. So as long as the Group is not accepted, the Item does not have to be accepted either. |

### ResponseItems

Response Items are sent inside of a Response. They contain the response data that is sent by the recipient of the Request. There are three different kinds of Response Items: `AcceptResponseItem`, `RejectResponseItem` and `ErrorResponseItem`. Depending on the actual RequestItem, there can be different derivations of these three items. For example, in case of a [`CreateAttributeRequestItem`](#createattributerequestitem), there is a special [`CreateAttributeAcceptResponseItem`](#createattributeacceptresponseitem), while for an [`AuthenticationRequestItem`](#authenticationrequestitem), the [`AcceptResponseItem`](#acceptresponseitem) can be used, because there is no additional information necessary next to whether it was accepted or rejected.

#### AcceptResponseItem

| items | [`ResponseItem`](#responseitem)`[]` | The items inside of this Group. For each RequestItem of the RequestItem Group, there must be one Response Item in the Response Item Group. Note that the indices have to be the same for matching Request and Response Items. |

## ResponseWrapper

The ResponseWrapper is a wrapper around the Response that is sent by the recipient of the Request. It contains the Response itself, but also some additional information that is required for the Request to be processed correctly.

| Name                   | Type                                    | Description                                                                                                        |

| requestSourceReference | `string`                                | The reference to the Message or RelationshipTemplate the Request was received with.                                |
| requestSourceType      | `"Message"` \| `"RelationshipTemplate"` | Specifies if the Request was transferred via [Message](#message) or [RelationshipTemplate](#relationshiptemplate). |
| response               | [`Response`](#response)                 | The Response that is sent by the recipient of the Request.                                                         |

## Notification

Notifications provide you with the possibility to notify a peer about something, e.g. the succession of one of your Attributes.
However, unlike [Requests](#request) they don't offer the option to make a decision whether or not they want to accept this change.
In the example of Attribute succession, the peer can not decide to accept or reject the updated value, but is simply informed about it.

| Name  | Type                                       | Description                                                                                                        |

| items | [`NotificationItem[]`](#notificationitems) | An array of NotificationItems that are part of the Notification. There must be at least one Item per Notification. |

### NotificationItems

NotificationItems are sent inside a Notification and specify which processes should be triggered when receiving the Notification.

#### PeerSharedAttributeSucceededNotificationItem

A PeerSharedAttributeSucceededNotificationItem will be sent, if an Attribute, a peer shared with you, was succeeded by them and they choose to notify you about it.
Internally, the succeeded version will then be created at your side as successor for your previously received Attribute.

| Name             | Type                                                                                           | Description                                        |

| successorId      | `string`                                                                                       | The `id` of the LocalAttribute it was succeeded by |
| successorContent | [`IdentityAttribute`](#identityattribute) \| [`RelationshipAttribute`](#relationshipattribute) | The updated content of the LocalAttribute          |

## Attributes

An Attribute is some piece of information about an Identity itself (e.g. its name, address, birth date, etc.) or about an Identity in the context of a Relationship (e.g. the customer id the of the user the Relationship). Since the two scenarios differ quite a lot, there are two different types for them: IdentityAttribute and RelationshipAttribute.

### IdentityAttribute

IdentityAttributes describe an Identity itself. Their values are strongly normalized. There is a list of available values [here]({% link _docs_integrate/attribute-values.md %}).

| Name      | Type                                                                                           | Description                                                                                                       |

### RelationshipAttribute

RelationshipAttributes describe an Identity in the context of a Relationship. While there are some types that can be used as a value for a RelationshipAttribute, these types are rather generic (e.g. `ProprietaryString`, `ProprietaryInteger`, ...).

## AttributeQueries

One of the main features of enmeshed is sharing Attributes. For this, an Identity either proactively sends its Attributes to a peer. Or, if let's say a company wants to know the birth date of its customer, it can ask for it. Depending on the exact use case, the latter can be achieved with one of a bunch of RequestItems, like for example a [`ReadAttributeRequestItem`](#readattributerequestitem), or a [`CreateAttributeListenerRequestItem`](#createattributerequestitem). All of them have in common that they define a `query` property, which contains either an [`IdentityAttributeQuery`](#identityattributequery) or a [`RelationshipAttributeQuery`](#relationshipattributequery).

### IdentityAttributeQuery

An `IdentityAttributeQuery` is used to query for IdentityAttributes. For that, it defines the following properties:

| Name      | Type                       | Description                                                                                         |
| --------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @type     | `"IdentityAttributeQuery"` |                                                                                                     |
| validFrom | `string` \| `undefined`    | The start date of the time frame the returned Attribute should be valid in.                         |
| validTo   | `string` \| `undefined`    | The end date of the time frame the returned Attribute should be valid in.                           |
| valueType | `string`                   | The type of value that should be queried, e.g. `"StreetAddress"`, `"BirthDate"` or `"Nationality"`. |
| tags      | `string[]` \| `undefined`  | To specify additional information.                                                                  |

You can only query IdentityAttributes owned by the recipient of the query.

### RelationshipAttributeQuery

There are cases in which you want to query some data from your peer that is not an IdentityAttribute. An example for this is when an electricity provider asks for the electric meter number of a new customer. Since this information is only relevant in the context of the Relationship, an IdentityAttribute wouldn't make any sense here. That's why you would send a `RelationshipAttributeQuery`. Its properties are:

| Name                   | Type                                                                        | Description                                                                                            |

### ThirdPartyRelationshipAttributeQuery

If you want to query Attributes the user has in the context of a Relationship with a third party, you can use the `ThirdPartyRelationshipAttributeQuery`. An example would be the query for the number of a bonus card managed by another company (like Payback). A ThirdPartyRelationshipAttributeQuery has the following properties:

| Name       | Type                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |

| validFrom  | `string` \| `undefined`                  | The start date of the time frame the returned Attribute should be valid in.                                                                                                         |
| validTo    | `string` \| `undefined`                  | The end date of the time frame the returned Attribute should be valid in.                                                                                                           |

| owner      | `string`                                 | The owner of the queried RelationshipAttribute. Can be an empty string (`""`), if the owner is unknown or you are querying from multiple thirdParties that could own the attribute. |
| thirdParty | `string[]`                               | The Address of the third parties the RelationshipAttribute should be queried from.                                                                                                  |

### IQLQuery

If you want to query Attributes by their content, you can use the `IQLQuery`.
It allows you to specify conditions the Attribute must match and which may be chained using binary operations.
Every property of the Attribute's content may be queried, independend of whether it is nested or not, by formulating it as a lowercase key.
Furthermore, using an uppercase term is a shortcut for comparing the term to the `value.@type` property and using `#` refers to the `tag` property.
For example, if you want to query a `StreetAddress` in Germany which is tagged as `[Primary Address]` the `queryString` would be `StreetAddress && value.country.value == Germany && #"Primary Address"`.
If no corresponding Attribute exists at the peer's side, you are given the possibility to add `attributeCreationHints`, suggesting to create an Attribute which matches a specific `valueType` and optionally `tags`.

## RelationshipTemplateContent

Theoretically you can send any kind of data in a Relationship Template. However, if your peer uses the enmeshed App, it will only be able to process Relationship Templates that contain a `RelationshipTemplateContent`, which looks like this:

| Name                   | Type                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| title                  | `string` \| `undefined`              | An optional, human readable title that should be rendered in the UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| metadata               | `object` \| `undefined`              | Optional custom metadata that can be sent together with the Relationship Template. This property is meant purely for developers who integrate with enmeshed. They can write for example some kind of key into this property, which can be used later to identify the content of this Template.                                                                                                                             |
| onNewRelationship      | [`Request`](#request)                | The Request that should pop up to the user in case there is no Relationship yet. In this Request you can send Attributes of yourself the user needs to in order to know who's Template it is (e.g. company name, address, ...), as ask for Attributes of the user you need to know in the Relationship, or send some information you already know about the user, so it can be saved in its wallet (e.g. the customer id). |
| onExistingRelationship | [`Request`](#request) \| `undefined` | The Request that should pop up to the user in case a Relationship already exists. An example usage is a Request with an `AuthenticationRequestItem` for the sake of two-factor authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## RelationshipCreationChangeRequestContent

The naming on this one in combination with its `response` property is a bit confusing. Even though the `RelationshipCreationChangeRequestContent` contains the word "Request", it has a `response` property.
This is because in the context of Relationships, there are [Relationship Changes](#relationshipchange), which have a `request` and a `response` property. But caution: these have nothing to do with the Content-types `Request` and `Response`.

| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @type    | `"RelationshipCreationChangeRequestContent"` |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| response | [`Response`](#response)                      | The Response to the Request that was contained in the [RelationshipTemplateContent](#relationshiptemplatecontent) (either in the `onExistingRelationship` property or in the `onNewRelationship` property). |

## Mail

A Mail can be sent as the content of a [Message](#message). It is comparable with the classic email, so its properties should not contain any surprise.

| Name    | Type                      | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @type   | `"Mail"`                  |                                                                                                             |
| to      | `string[]`                | The enmeshed Addresses of the main recipients of this Mail.                                                 |
| cc      | `string[]` \| `undefined` | The enmeshed Addresses that should receive a copy of this Mail, additionally to the ones specified in `to`. |
| subject | `string`                  | The subject of the Mail.                                                                                    |
| body    | `string`                  | The body of the Mail.                                                                                       |

## DecideRequestItemParameters

In order to answer a Request, the Response must be formulated appropriately.
As an easier interface to do so various `DecideRequestItemParameters` are provided.
If you want to reject any RequestItem, you must use the `RejectRequestItemParameters`.
If you want to accept a RequestItem, however, depending on its kind you might need different parameters.
For example, an AuthenticationRequestItem can be accepted using the AcceptRequestItemParameters, but for a FreeTextRequestItem `AcceptFreeTextRequestItemParameters` are required.
