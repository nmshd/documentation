The connector would like to save an attribute for another identity and has 2 options for this.

The Create Attribute creates a request that the peer can accept and thus an attribute is created. To avoid errors, it is better to use the "Propose attribute" request for some attributes, so that the user has the option of customizing the attribute to be saved.
