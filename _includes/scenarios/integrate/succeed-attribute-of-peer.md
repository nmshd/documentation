# Flow

If IdentityA has a more up-to-date value of an Attribute of IdentityB, a RequestSucceedAttributeRequestItem can actively request an Attribute succession of someone else.

To ensure traceability, attributes cannot be overwritten directly, but only a new version can be saved, which is linked to the predecessors.
