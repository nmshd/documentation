Be advised that this is an App-specific use-case which is triggered by a manual user interaction. Although it is a very generic use-case which one would normally not describe, we introduced it because we require it in our overarching scenarios.

The cancel action use-case generally describes the action a user manually triggers on an App screen to stop a running process that has already been started, or to cancel the current user interface context by navigating back or close a popup.

An example could be the user started to write a Mail to a contact and decides not to send it and returns to the home screen.
