Be advised that this is an App-specific use-case which is triggered by a manual user interaction. Although it is a very generic use-case which one would normally not describe, we introduced it because we require it in our overarching scenarios.
{: .notice--info}

This App use-case broadly describes a dissent of the user with the information on a screen, and thus triggers a negative action on the screen.

For example, the user manually rejects an incoming Request or RelationshipTemplate, because too much personal data is requested.
