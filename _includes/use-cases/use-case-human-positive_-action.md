Be advised that this is an App-specific use-case which is triggered by a manual user interaction. Although it is a very generic use-case which one would normally not describe, we introduced it because we require it in our overarching scenarios.
{: .notice--info}

This use-case broadly describes the manual action of a user that indicates consent with something shown on the screen and thus a positive action of the screen is triggered.

For example, the user manually accepts an incoming Request or RelationshipTemplate in order to submit the requested data.
