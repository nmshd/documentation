{% include properties_list.html %}

This use-case describes the app's behavior when the user is idle on a specific screen.
To keep the screen's data in sync with what is actually happening (i.e. if the status
of a request changes) the app refreshed its screen when necessary.

These refreshes are automatically triggered when relevant data changes.
