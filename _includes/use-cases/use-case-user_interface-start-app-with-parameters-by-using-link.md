{% include properties_list.html %}

Be advised that this is an App-specific use-case which is triggered without a user interaction. Although it is a very generic use-case which one would normally not describe, we introduced it because we require it in our overarching scenarios.
{: .notice--info}

This use-case triggers the opening of the App using an enmeshed-specific link, e.g. to onboard a new Relationship. An example of this would be a URI starting with `nmshd:` as a protocol.
