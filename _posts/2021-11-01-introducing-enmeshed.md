Hello everyone!

We are delighted to introduce a new open source project named Enmeshed. It is the home of software libraries, components, ideas, discussions, and many more in the area of digitalization.

We think the world is ready for a whole new adventure of digital communication, easy and secure data sharing, and empowering the user - while using state-of-the-art technologies and proven architectures without forgetting the user experience, integration, processes, security or privacy.

This site is still under construction and as such, we will update it regularly in the coming weeks.

Your Enmeshed Team
