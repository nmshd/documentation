This is one of the blog posts regarding Enmeshed v2. For an overview of all Enmeshed v2 blog posts, please refer to the [Enmeshed v2 announcement blog post]({% post_url 2022-06-27-announcing-enmeshed-v2 %}).

This blog post requires a superficial understanding of the new Attribute handling. Please refer to the [corresponding blog post]({% post_url 2022-06-30-announcing-enmeshed-v2-attributes %}) to learn more about it if you are not yet familiar with it.

This blog post describes what Requests are in the Enmeshed universe and how they are used to exchange Attributes and establish Relationships.

When we mention "the App" or "the Connector" in this blog post, we mean the official [Enmeshed App]({% link _docs_explore/50-app.md %}) and [Enmeshed Connector]({% link _docs_explore/52-connector.md %}).

Keep in mind that we cannot describe all details in this blog post. Refer to the V2 documentation for further information about how Requests are working "under the hood".

## Requests

Requests in Enmeshed always defined a way to exchange structured data. In Enmeshed V1 this was exclusively about exchanging structured Attributes with its AttributesChangeRequest and AttributesShareRequest. In V1 there also was no defined response structure, as well as no track record of Requests and their status. Thus, V1 Requests were quite limited.

Requests in V2 extend the Request featureset by providing more structured Requests, as well as Requests for unstructured data. Additionally, they are not fixed to the Identitity's Attributes. One example is a form you can send to a User, which contains some questions in natural language, which does not affect the Attributes. Another example is a Multi-Factor-Authentication Request which might be available in the future.

In Enmeshed V1 `RelationshipTemplates` and `RequestMails` each defined their own way for exchanging Attributes. Further only the App could process them. When integrating via the Connector you had to manually process all Requests. For V2 we pulled the Request handling [from the User-Experience Layer to the Consumption layer]({% link _docs_explore/01-introduction.md %}/#layers). This enabled us to provide you with an API in the Connector to work with Requests. It also helped us making Request handling more flexible and easier to use.

## Exchanging Requests

The simplest way to exchange Requests is using Messages. But for sending Messages a Relationship is required. To create a Relationship we also wanted the possiblity to exchange Requests with the same structure.

### Relationships and RelationshipTemplates

The flow for establishing a Relationship between the App and another App or Connector has changed significantly. The body of the RelationshipTemplate is now a strict type that can be processed by the App and the Connector. It looks as follows:

```ts
interface RelationshipTemplateBody {
    "@type": "RelationshipTemplateBody";
    title?: string;
    metadata?: object;
    onNewRelationship: Request;
    onExistingRelationship?: Request;
}
```

More about the structure of a Request will follow in the V2 documentation.

When the RelationshipTemplate is scanned by the App, the Request (defined by the creator of the Template) is rendered for the User. This is similar to the flow in V1. The App will then automatically create the Relationship when the User accepts the Request.

### Messages

Messages can now be used to exchange the same Requests that are used to enter a Relationship. A Message can now simply contain the content `{ "@type": "Request", ... }` or `{ "@type": "Response", ... }`. The `RequestMail`, `AttributesChangeRequest` and `AttributesShareRequest` types are now deprecated and will be removed in the future. Because the Enmeshed V2 App will stop processing these types we strictly advise against further using them.

So far, only one Request can be sent with one Message. This is intentional, as with RequestItemGroups and RequestItems, various data or actions can be requested. If there is the need to submit multiple Requests, send multiple Messages.

## Modules managing Requests

The main component powering the Enmeshed App and the Enmeshed Connector is the Runtime. The Runtime is modular and we decided to use this to provide a module that automatically manages Requests. This module is highly important for the complete Enmeshed Logic and therefore automatically enabled and not possible to disable in the App and the Connector.

The module is responsible for:

-   creating an incoming Request when a peer RelationshipTemplate is loaded
-   scanning for Requests in received Messages to store it as incoming Requests in the database
-   scanning for Responses in received Messages to close outgoing Requests in the database
-   scanning for Requests in outgoing Messages to store it as outgoing Requests in the database
-   taking action when the User decides (accepts or rejects) a Request
    -   when the Request came from a Template the module creates a Relationship with the contents of the User's response if the User accepted the Request (rejection is currently not handled)
    -   when the Request came from a Message the module sends back a Message containing the User's response (accept and reject)
-   listen for an incoming Relationship to create a Request out of the RelationshipTemplate that was used to create the Relationship and to directly complete the Request using the Response sent with the RelationshipCreationChange

The second module is the Decider Module. At the moment this module is only responsible for moving a Request from the status `DecisionRequired` to the status `ManualDecisionRequired`. This indirection is a preparation for a feature we are planning to implement in the future, with which you will be able to configure the Decider Module so it automatically accepts certain Requests. We will publish a blog post about this when it is implemented.
