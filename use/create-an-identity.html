<meta name="description" content="This section is a pre-release Please note that this section of our documentation is currently under construction, and we are actively working on enhancing your experience. Thus you could encounter typos, mistakes, or bugs in below information. However, we would like you to receive the most up-to-date information as soon as possible, in order to understand, use and integrate enmeshed. Additionally, we would love to hear your feedback to this part of the documentation, e.g. by filing an issue in our feedback repository.  Identity  A new digital Identity can be created in the App by the user. The Identity is the user’s primary entity and digital twin. All data and metadata in enmeshed is stored for Identities. Every Identity represents a certain natural or legal person. One can create separate Identities for personal and professional purposes.  Devices  The Device which created an Identity automatically is onboarded to the Identity. But a user can add more Devices, to have multiple devices accessing the very same digital Identity. An Identity which is used by a mobile phone, a tablet and a laptop has onboarded three Devices.  Profiles  The user can manage multiple Identities with one single App. Each Identity-to-App combination is called a Profile. Thus, each Profile within the App represents a separate digital Identity for which the App can be used.  Example  Consider a user who has three Devices (phone, tablet and business laptop) and three Identities (personal, work, child). A senseful combination would be the following:  Multi-Device: Structured by Identities and their Devices:     Identity Personal            Device: Phone       Device: Tablet           Identity Child            Device: Phone       Device: Child           Identity Work            Device: Phone       Device: Business Laptop           Multi-Profile: Structured by Devices and their Profiles:     Device: Phone            Profile: Personal       Profile: Work       Profile: Child           Device: Tablet            Profile: Personal       Profile: Child           Device: Business Laptop            Profile: Work">

<h1 id="identity">Identity</h1>

<p>A new digital Identity can be created in the App by the user. The Identity is the user’s primary entity and digital twin. All data and metadata in enmeshed is stored for Identities. Every Identity represents a certain natural or legal person. One can create separate Identities for personal and professional purposes.</p>

<h1 id="devices">Devices</h1>

<p>The Device which created an Identity automatically is onboarded to the Identity. But a user can add more Devices, to have multiple devices accessing the very same digital Identity. An Identity which is used by a mobile phone, a tablet and a laptop has onboarded three Devices.</p>

<h1 id="profiles">Profiles</h1>

<p>The user can manage multiple Identities with one single App. Each Identity-to-App combination is called a Profile. Thus, each Profile within the App represents a separate digital Identity for which the App can be used.</p>

<h1 id="example">Example</h1>

<p>Consider a user who has three Devices (phone, tablet and business laptop) and three Identities (personal, work, child). A senseful combination would be the following:</p>

<p>Multi-Device: Structured by Identities and their Devices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identity Personal
    <ul>
      <li>Device: Phone</li>
      <li>Device: Tablet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Identity Child
    <ul>
      <li>Device: Phone</li>
      <li>Device: Child</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Identity Work
    <ul>
      <li>Device: Phone</li>
      <li>Device: Business Laptop</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Multi-Profile: Structured by Devices and their Profiles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Device: Phone
    <ul>
      <li>Profile: Personal</li>
      <li>Profile: Work</li>
      <li>Profile: Child</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Device: Tablet
    <ul>
      <li>Profile: Personal</li>
      <li>Profile: Child</li>
